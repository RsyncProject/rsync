NEWS for rsync 3.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 31 (changed)
Changes since 3.0.4:

  OUTPUT CHANGES:

    - Output numbers in 3-digit groups by default (e.g. 1,234,567).  See the
      --human-readable option for a way to turn it off.  See also the daemon's
      "log format" parameter and related command-line options (including
      --out-format) for a modifier that can be used to request digit-grouping
      or human-readable output in log escapes. (Note that log output is
      unchanged by default.)

    - The --list-only option is now affected by the --human-readable setting.
      It will display digit groupings by default, and unit suffixes if higher
      levels of readability are requested.  Also, the column width for the size
      output has increased from 11 to 14 characters when human readability is
      enabled.  Use --no-h to get the old-style output and column size.

    - The output of the --progress option has changed:  the string "xfer" was
      shortened to "xfr", and the string "to-check" was shortened to "to-chk",
      both designed to make room for the (by default) wider display of file
      size numbers without making the total line-length longer.  Also, when
      incremental recursion is enabled, the string "ir-chk" will be used
      instead of "to-chk" up until the incremental-recursion scan is done,
      letting you know that the value to check and the total value will still
      be increasing as new files are found.

    - Enhanced the --stats output: 1) to mention how many files were created
      (protocol >= 28), 2) to mention how many files were deleted (a new line
      for protocol 31, but only output when --delete is in effect), and 3) to
      follow the file-count, created-count, and deleted-count with a subcount
      list that shows the counts by type.  The wording of the transferred count
      has also changed so that it is clearer that it is only a count of regular
      files.

  BUG FIXES:

    - Changed the way --progress overwrites its prior output in order to make
      it nearly impossible for the progress to get overwritten by an error.

    - Fixed some rare bugs in --iconv processing that might cause a multibyte
      character to get translated incorrectly.

    - Improved the propagation of abnormal-exit error messages.  This should
      help the client side to receive errors from the server when it is exiting
      abnormally, and should also avoid dying with an "connection unexpectedly
      closed" exit when the closed connection is really expected.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --remote-option=OPT (-M OPT) command-line option that is useful
      for things like sending a remote --log-file=FILE or --fake-super option.

    - Added the --info=FLAGS and --debug=FLAGS options to allow finer-grained
      control over what is output.  Added an extra type of --progress output
      using --info=progress2.

    - The --msgs2stderr option can help with debugging rsync by allowing the
      debug messages to get output to stderr rather than travel via the socket
      protocol.

    - Added the --delete-missing-args and --ignore-missing-args options to
      either delete or ignore user-specified files on the receiver that are
      missing on the sender (normally the absence of user-specified files
      generates an error).

    - Added a "T" (terabyte) category to the --human-readable size suffixes.

    - Added the --usermap/--groupmap/--chown options for manipulating file
      ownership during the copy.

    - Added the "%C" escape to the log-output handling, which will output the
      MD5 checksum of any transferred file, or all files if --checksum was
      specified (when protocol 30 or above is in effect).

    - Added the "reverse lookup" parameter to the rsync daemon config file to
      allow reverse-DNS lookups to be disabled.

    - Added a forward-DNS lookup for the daemon's hosts allow/deny config.  Can
      be disabled via "forward lookup" parameter (defaults to enabled).

    - Added a way for more than one group to be specified in the daemon's
      config file, including a way to specify that you want all of the
      specified user's groups without having to name them.  Also changed the
      daemon to complain about an inability to set explicitly-specified uid/gid
      values, even when not run by a super-user.

    - Added per-user authorization options and group-authorization support to
      the daemon's "auth users" parameter.

    - Added a way to reference environment variables in a daemon's config file
      (using %VAR% references).

    - When replacing a non-dir with a symlink/hard-link/device/special-file,
      the update should now be done in an atomic manner.

    - Fixed a free of the wrong pointer in uncache_tmp_xattrs() (which only
      sometimes affects an --xattr transfer when --backup is used).

    - When backing up a file, try to hard-link the file into place so that the
      upcoming replacement of the destination file will be atomic.

    - Added the ability to synchronize nano-second modified times.

    - Added a few more default suffixes for the "dont compress" settings.

    - Added the checking of the RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS environment variable to allow
      the default for the --protect-args command-line option to be overridden.

    - Added some Solaris xattr code.

  EXTRAS:

    - Added an "instant-rsyncd" script to the support directory, which makes
      it easy to configure a simple rsync daemon in the current directory.

    - Added the "mapfrom" and "mapto" scripts to the support directory, which
      makes it easier to do user/group mapping in a local transfer based on
      passwd/group files from another machine.

  INTERNAL:

    - The I/O code was rewritten to be simpler and do bigger buffered reads
      over the socket.  The I/O between the receiver and the generator was
      changed to be standard multiplexed-I/O (like that over the socket).

    - The sender tries to use any dead time while the generator is looking for
      files to transfer in order to do sender-side directory scanning in a more
      parallel manner.

    - A daemon can now inform a client about a daemon-configured timeout value
      so that the client can assist in the keep-alive activity (protocol 31).

    - The filter code received some refactoring to make it more extendable, to
      read better, and do better sanity checking.

    - Really big numbers are now output using our own big-num routine rather
      than casting them to a double and using a %.0f conversion.

    - The pool_alloc library has received some minor improvements in alignment
      handling.

    - Added init_stat_x() function to avoid duplication of acl/xattr init code.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Added more conditional debug output.

    - Changed configure.in to configure.ac.
