# Citing README.md:
#
#   [...] Using ssh is recommended for its security features.
#
#   Alternatively, rsync can run in `daemon' mode, listening on a socket.
#   This is generally used for public file distribution, [...]
#
# So let's assume some extra security is more than welcome here. We do full
# system protection (which makes it read-only) and hide users' homes and
# devices. To override these defaults, it's best to do so in the drop-in
# directory, often done via `systemctl edit rsync.service`. The file needs
# just the bare minimum of the right [heading] and override values.
# See systemd.unit(5) and search for "drop-in" for full details.
