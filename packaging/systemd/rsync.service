# Citing README.md:
#
#   [...] Using ssh is recommended for its security features.
#
#   Alternatively, rsync can run in `daemon' mode, listening on a socket.
#   This is generally used for public file distribution, [...]
#
# So let's assume some extra security is more than welcome here. We do full
# system protection (which makes it read-only) and hide users' homes and
# devices. See systemd.unit(5) and search for "drop-in" to override.
