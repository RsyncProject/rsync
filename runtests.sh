# rsync top-level test script -- this invokes all the other more
# detailed tests in order.  This script can either be called by `make
# check' or `make installcheck'.  `check' runs against the copies of
# the program and other files in the build directory, and
# `installcheck' against the installed copy of the program.

# It can also be called on a single test file using a run like this:
#
#  preserve_scratch=yes whichtests=itemize.test ./runtests.sh

# In either case we need to also be able to find the source directory,
# since we read test scripts and possibly other information from
# there.

# Whenever possible, informational messages are written to stdout and
# error messages to stderr.  They're separated out by the build farm
# display scripts.

# According to the GNU autoconf manual, the only valid place to set up
# directory locations is through Make, since users are allowed to (try
# to) change their mind on the Make command line.  So, Make has to
# pass in all the values we need.

# For other configured settings we read ./config.sh, which tells us
# about shell commands on this machine and similar things.

# rsync_bin gives the location of the rsync binary.  This is either
# builddir/rsync if we're testing an uninstalled copy, or
# install_prefix/bin/rsync if we're testing an installed copy.  On the
# build farm rsync will be installed, but into a scratch /usr.

# srcdir gives the location of the source tree, which lets us find the
# build scripts.  At the moment we assume we are invoked from the
# source directory.

# This script must be invoked from the build directory.

# A scratch directory, 'testtmp', is used in the build directory to
# hold per-test subdirectories.

# This script also uses the $loglevel environment variable.  1 is the
# default value, and 10 the most verbose.  You can set this from the
# Make command line.  It's also set by the build farm to give more
# detail for failing builds.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTES FOR TEST CASES:

# Each test case runs in its own shell.

# Exit codes from tests:

#    1  tests failed
#    2  error in starting tests
#   77  this test skipped (random value unlikely to happen by chance, same as
#       automake)

# HOWEVER, the overall exit code to the farm is different: we return
# the *number of tests that failed*, so that it will show up nicely in
# the overall summary.

# rsync.fns contains some general setup functions and definitions.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTES ON PORTABILITY:

# Both this script and the Makefile have to be pretty conservative
# about which Unix features they use.

# We cannot count on Make exporting variables to commands, unless
# they're explicitly given on the command line.

# Also, we can't count on 'cp -a' or 'mkdir -p', although they're
# pretty handy (see function makepath for the latter).

# I think some of the GNU documentation suggests that we shouldn't
# rely on shell functions.  However, the Bash manual seems to say that
# they're in POSIX 1003.2, and since the build farm relies on them
# they're probably working on most machines we really care about.

# You cannot use "function foo {" syntax, but must instead say "foo()
# {", or it breaks on FreeBSD.

# BSD machines tend not to have "head" or "seq".

# You cannot do "export VAR=VALUE" all on one line; the export must be
# separate from the assignment.  (SCO SysV)

# Don't rely on grep -q, as that doesn't work everywhere -- just redirect
# stdout to /dev/null to keep it quiet.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STILL TO DO:

# We need a good protection against tests that hang indefinitely.
# Perhaps some combination of starting them in the background, wait,
# and kill?

# Perhaps we need a common way to cleanup tests.  At the moment just
# clobbering the directory when we're done should be enough.

# If any of the targets fail, then (GNU?) Make returns 2, instead of
# the return code from the failing command.  This is fine, but it
# means that the build farm just shows "2" for failed tests, not the
# number of tests that actually failed.  For more details we might
# need to grovel through the log files to find a line saying how many
# failed.
