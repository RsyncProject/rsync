NEWS for rsync 3.0.6 (8 May 2009)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.5:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a --read-batch hang when rsync is reading a batch file that was
      created from an incremental-recursion transfer.

    - Fixed the daemon's socket code to handle the simultaneous arrival of
      multiple connections.

    - Fix --safe-links/--copy-unsafe-links to properly handle symlinks that
      have consecutive slashes in the value.

    - Fixed the parsing of an [IPv6_LITERAL_ADDR] when a USER@ is prefixed.

    - The sender now skips a (bogus) symlink that has a 0-length value, which
      avoids a transfer error in the receiver.

    - Fixed a case where the sender could die with a tag-0 error if there was
      an I/O during the sending of the file list.

    - Fixed the rrsync script to avoid a server-side problem when -e is at the
      start of the short options.

    - Fixed a problem where a vanished directory could turn into an exit code
      23 instead of the proper exit code 24.

    - Fixed the --iconv conversion of symlinks when doing a local copy.

    - Fixed a problem where --one-file-system was not stopping deletions on the
      receiving side when a mount-point directory did not match a directory in
      the transfer.

    - Fixed the dropping of an ACL mask when no named ACL values were present.

    - Fixed an ACL/xattr corruption issue where the --backup option could cause
      rsync to associate the wrong ACL/xattr information with received files.

    - Fixed the use of --xattrs with --only-write-batch.

    - Fixed the use of --dry-run with --read-batch.

    - Fixed configure's erroneous use of target.

    - Fixed configure's --disable-debug option.

    - Fixed a run-time issue for systems that can't find iconv_open() by adding
      the --disable-iconv-open configure option.

    - Complain and die if the user tries to combine --remove-source-files (or
      the deprecated --remove-sent-files) with --read-batch.

    - Fixed an failure transferring special files from Solaris to Linux.


NEWS for rsync 3.0.5 (28 Dec 2008)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.4:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Initialize xattr data in a couple spots in the hlink code, which avoids a
      crash when the xattr pointer's memory happens to start out non-zero.
      Also fixed the itemizing of an alt-dest file's xattrs when hard-linking.

    - Don't send a bogus "-" option to an older server if there were no short
      options specified.

    - Fixed skipping of unneeded updates in a batch file when incremental
      recursion is active.  Added a test for this.  Made batch-mode handle
      "redo" files properly (and without hanging).

    - Fix the %P logfile escape when the daemon logs from inside a chroot.

    - Fixed the use of -s (--protect-args) when used with a remote source or
      destination that had an empty path (e.g. "host:").  Also fixed a problem
      when -s was used when accessing a daemon via a remote-shell.

    - Fixed the use of a dot-dir path (e.g. foo/./bar) inside a --files-from
      file when the root of the transfer isn't the current directory.

    - Fixed a bug with "-K --delete" removing symlinks to directories when
      incremental recursion is active.

    - Fixed a hard to trigger hang when using --remove-source-files.

    - Got rid of an annoying delay when accessing a daemon via a remote-shell.

    - Properly ignore (superfluous) source args on a --read-batch command.

    - Improved the manpage's description of the '*' wildcard to remove the
      confusing "non-empty" qualifier.

    - Fixed reverse lookups in the compatibility-library version of
      getnameinfo().

    - Fixed a bug when using --sparse on a sparse file that has over 2GB of
      consecutive sparse data.

    - Avoid a hang when using at least 3 --verbose options on a transfer with a
      client sender (which includes local copying).

    - Fixed a problem with --delete-delay reporting an error when it was ready
      to remove a directory that was now gone.

    - Got rid of a bunch of "warn_unused_result" compiler warnings.

    - If an ftruncate() on a received file fails, it now causes a partial-
      transfer warning.

    - Allow a path with a leading "//" to be preserved (CYGWIN only).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Made the support/atomic-rsync script able to perform a fully atomic
      update of the copied hierarchy when the destination is setup using a
      particular symlink idiom.


NEWS for rsync 3.0.4 (6 Sep 2008)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the hard-linking code where it would sometimes try to
      allocate 0 bytes of memory (which fails on some OSes, such as AIX).

    - Fixed the hard-linking of files from a device that has a device number
      of 0 (which seems to be a common device number on NetBSD).

    - Fixed the handling of a --partial-dir that cannot be created.  This
      particularly impacts the --delay-updates option (since the files cannot
      be delayed without a partial-dir), and was potentially destructive if
      the --remove-source-files was also specified.

    - Fixed a couple issues in the --fake-super handling of xattrs when the
      destination files have root-level attributes (e.g. selinux values) that
      a non-root copy can't affect.

    - Improved the keep-alive check in the generator to fire consistently in
      incremental-recursion mode when --timeout is enabled.

    - The --iconv option now converts the content of a symlink too, instead
      of leaving it in the wrong character-set (requires 3.0.4 on both sides
      of the transfer).

    - When using --iconv, if a filename fails to convert on the receiving side,
      this no longer makes deletions in the root-dir of the transfer fail
      silently (the user now gets a warning about deletions being disabled
      due to IO error as long as --ignore-errors was not specified).

    - When using --iconv, if a server-side receiver can't convert a filename,
      the error message sent back to the client no longer mangles the name
      with the wrong charset conversion.

    - Fixed a potential alignment issue in the IRIX ACL code when allocating
      the initial "struct acl" object.  Also, cast mallocs to avoid warnings.

    - Changed some errors that were going to stdout to go to stderr.

    - Made human_num() and human_dnum() able to output a negative number
      (rather than outputting a cryptic string of punctuation).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Rsync will avoid sending an -e option to the server if an older protocol
      is requested (and thus the option would not be useful).  This lets the
      user specify the --protocol=29 option to access an overly-restrictive
      server that is rejecting the protocol-30 use of -e to the server.

    - Improved the message output for an RERR_PARTIAL exit.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The Makefile will not halt for just a timestamp change on the Makefile
      or the configure files, only for actual changes in content.

    - Changed some commands in the testsuite's xattrs.test that called "rsync"
      instead of "$RSYNC".

    - Enhanced the release scripts to be able to handle a branch release and
      to do even more consistency checks on the files.


NEWS for rsync 3.0.3 (29 Jun 2008)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.2:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a wildcard matching problem in the daemon when a module has
      "use chroot" enabled.

    - Fixed a crash bug in the hard-link code.

    - Fixed the sending of xattr directory information when the code finds a
      --link-dest or --copy-dest directory with unchanged xattrs -- the
      destination directory now gets these unchanged xattrs properly applied.

    - Fixed an xattr-sending glitch that could cause an "Internal abbrev"
      error.

    - Fixed the combination of --xattrs and --backup.

    - The generator no longer allows a '.' dir to be excluded by a daemon-
      exclude rule.

    - Fixed deletion handling when copying a single, empty directory (with no
      files) to a differently named, non-existent directory.

    - Fixed the conversion of spaces into dashes in the %M log escape.

    - Fixed several places in the code that were not returning the right
      errno when a function failed.

    - Fixed the backing up of a device or special file into a backup dir.

    - Moved the setting of the socket options prior to the connect().

    - If rsync exits in the middle of a --progress output, it now outputs a
      newline to help prevent the progress line from being overwritten.

    - Fixed a problem with how a destination path with a trailing slash or
      a trailing dot-dir was compared against the daemon excludes.

    - Fixed the sending of large (size > 16GB) files when talking to an older
      rsync (protocols < 30):  we now use a compatible block size limit.

    - If a file's length is so huge that we overflow a checksum buffer count
      (i.e. several hundred TB), warn the user and avoid sending an invalid
      checksum struct over the wire.

    - If a source arg is excluded, --relative no longer adds the excluded
      arg's implied dirs to the transfer.  This fix also made the exclude
      check happen in the better place in the sending code.

    - Use the overflow_exit() function for overflows, not out_of_memory().

    - Improved the code to better handle a system that has only 32-bit file
      offsets.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - The rsyncd.conf manpage now consistently refers to the parameters in
      the daemon config file as "parameters".

    - The description of the --inplace option was improved.

  EXTRAS:

    - Added a new script in the support directory, deny-rsync, which allows
      an admin to (temporarily) replace the rsync command with a script that
      sends an error message to the remote client via the rsync protocol.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Fixed a testcase failure if the tests are run as root and made some
      compatibility improvements.

    - Improved the daemon tests, including checking module comments, the
      listing of files, and the ensuring that daemon excludes can't affect
      a dot-dir arg.

    - Improved some build rules for those that build in a separate directory
      from the source, including better install rules for the man pages, and
      the fixing of a proto.h-tstamp rule that could make the binaries get
      rebuild without cause.

    - Improved the testsuite to work around a problem with some utilities
      (e.g. cp -p & touch -r) rounding sub-second timestamps.

    - Ensure that the early patches don't cause any generated-file hunks to
      bleed-over into patches that follow.


NEWS for rsync 3.0.2 (8 Apr 2008)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.1:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a potential buffer overflow in the xattr code.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - None.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The RPM spec file was improved to install more useful files.

    - A few developer-oriented scripts were moved from the support dir
      to the packaging dir.


NEWS for rsync 3.0.1 (3 Apr 2008)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.0:

  NOTABLE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR:

    - Added the 'c'-flag to the itemizing of non-regular files so that the
      itemized output doesn't get hidden if there were no attribute changes,
      and also so that the itemizing of a --copy-links run will distinguish
      between copying an identical non-regular file and the creation of a
      revised version with a new value (e.g. a changed symlink referent, a
      new device number, etc.).

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a crash bug when a single-use rsync daemon (via remote shell) was
      run without specifying a --config=FILE option.

    - Fixed a crash when backing up a directory that has a default ACL.

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of xattr values that could cause rsync to
      not think that a file's extended attributes are up-to-date.

    - Fixed the working of --fake-super with --link-dest and --xattrs.

    - Fixed a hang when combining --dry-run with --remove-source-files.

    - Fixed a bug with --iconv's handling of files that cannot be converted:
      a failed name can no longer cause a transfer failure.

    - Fixed the building of the rounding.h file on systems that need custom
      CPPFLAGS to be used.  Also improved the error reporting if the building
      of rounding.h fails.

    - Fixed the use of the --protect-args (-s) option when talking to a daemon.

    - Fixed the --ignore-existing option's protection of files on the receiver
      that are non-regular files on the sender (e.g. if a symlink or a dir on
      the sender is trying to replace a file on the receiver).  The reverse
      protection (protecting a dir/symlink/device from being replaced by a
      file) was already working.

    - Fixed an assert failure if --hard-links is combined with an option that
      can skip a file in a set of hard-linked files (i.e. --ignore-existing,
      --append, etc.), without skipping all the files in the set.

    - Avoid setting the modify time on a directory that already has the right
      modify time set.  This avoids tweaking the dir's ctime.

    - Improved the daemon-exclude handling to do a better job of applying the
      exclude rules to path entries.  It also sends the user an error just as
      if the files were actually missing (instead of silently ignoring the
      user's args), and avoids sending the user the filter-action messages
      for these non-user-initiated rules.

    - Fixed some glitches with the dry-run code's missing-directory
      handling, including a problem when combined with --fuzzy.

    - Fixed some glitches with the skipped-directory handling.

    - Fixed the 'T'-flag itemizing of symlinks when --time isn't preserved.

    - Fixed a glitch in the itemizing of permissions with the -E option.

    - The --append option's restricting of transfers to those that add data no
      longer prevents the updating of non-content changes to otherwise up-to-
      date files (i.e. those with the same content but differing permissions,
      ownership, xattrs, etc.).

    - Don't allow --fake-super to be specified with -XX (double --xattrs)
      because the options conflict.  If a daemon has "fake super" enabled,
      it automatically downgrades a -XX request to -X.

    - Fixed a couple bugs in the parsing of daemon-config excludes that could
      make a floating exclude rule get treated as matching an absolute path.

    - A daemon doesn't try to auto-refuse the "iconv" option if iconv-support
      wasn't compiled in to the daemon (avoiding a warning in the logs).

    - Fixed the inclusion of per-dir merge files from implied dirs.

    - Fixed the support/rrsync script to work with the latest options that
      rsync sends (including its flag-specifying use of -e to the server).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --old-dirs (--old-d) option to make it easier for a user to
      ask for file-listings with older rsync versions (this is easier than
      having to type "-r --exclude='/*/*'" manually).

    - When getting an error while asking an older rsync daemon for a file
      listing, rsync will try to notice if the error is a rejection of the
      --dirs (-d) option and let the user know how to work around the issue.

    - Added a few more --no-OPTION overrides.

    - Improved the documentation of the --append option.

    - Improved the documentation of the filter/exclude/include daemon
      parameters.

  INTERNAL:

    - Fixed a couple minor bugs in the included popt library (ones which I
      sent to the official popt project for inclusion in the 1.14 release).

    - Fixed a stat() call that should have been do_stat() so that the proper
      normal/64-bit stat() function gets called.  (Was in an area that should
      not have caused problems, though.)

    - Changed the file-glob code to do a directory scan without using the
      "glob" and "glob.h".  This lets us do the globbing with less memory
      churn, and also avoid adding daemon-excluded items to the returned
      args.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The configure script tries to get the user's compiler to not warn about
      unused function parameters if the build is not including one or more of
      the ACL/xattrs/iconv features.

    - The configure script now has better checks for figuring out if the
      included popt code should be used or not.

    - Fixed two testsuite glitches: avoid a failure if someone's "cd" command
      outputs the current directory when cd-ing to a relative path, and made
      the itemized test query how rsync was built to determine if it should
      expect hard-linked symlinks or not.

    - Updated the testsuite to verify that various bug fixes remain fixed.

    - The RPM spec file was updated to have: (1) comments for how to use the
      rsync-patch tar file, and (2) an /etc/xinetd.d/rsync file.

    - Updated the build scripts to work with a revised FTP directory
      structure.


NEWS for rsync 3.0.0 (1 Mar 2008)
Protocol: 30 (changed)
Changes since 2.6.9:

  NOTABLE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR:

    - The handling of implied directories when using --relative has changed to
      send them as directories (e.g. no implied dir is ever sent as a symlink).
      This avoids unexpected behavior and should not adversely affect most
      people.  If you're one of those rare individuals who relied upon having
      an implied dir be duplicated as a symlink, you should specify the
      transfer of the symlink and the transfer of the referent directory as
      separate args.  (See also --keep-dirlinks and --no-implied-dirs.)
      Also, exclude rules no longer have a partial effect on implied dirs.

    - Requesting a remote file-listing without specifying -r (--recursive) now
      sends the -d (--dirs) option to the remote rsync rather than sending -r
      along with an extra exclude of /*/*.  If the remote rsync does not
      understand the -d option (i.e. it is 2.6.3 or older), you will need to
      either turn off -d (--no-d), or specify  -r --exclude='/*/*'  manually.

    - In --dry-run mode, the last line of the verbose summary text is output
      with a "(DRY RUN)" suffix to help remind you that no updates were made.
      Similarly, --only-write-batch outputs "(BATCH ONLY)".

    - A writable rsync daemon with "use chroot" disabled now defaults to a
      symlink-munging behavior designed to make symlinks safer while also
      allowing absolute symlinks to be stored and retrieved.  This also has
      the effect of making symlinks unusable while they're in the daemon's
      hierarchy.  See the daemon's "munge symlinks" parameter for details.

    - Starting up an extra copy of an rsync daemon will not clobber the pidfile
      for the running daemon -- if the pidfile exists, the new daemon will exit
      with an error.  This means that your wrapper script that starts the rsync
      daemon should be made to handle lock-breaking (if you want any automatic
      breaking of locks to be done).

  BUG FIXES:

    - A daemon with "use chroot = no" and excluded items listed in the daemon
      config file now properly checks an absolute-path arg specified for these
      options:  --compare-dest, --link-dest, --copy-dest, --partial-dir,
      --backup-dir, --temp-dir, and --files-from.

    - A daemon can now be told to disable all user- and group-name translation
      on a per-module basis.  This avoids a potential problem with a writable
      daemon module that has "use chroot" enabled -- if precautions weren't
      taken, a user could try to add a missing library and get rsync to use
      it.  This makes rsync safer by default, and more configurable when id-
      translation is not desired.  See the daemon's "numeric ids" parameter
      for full details.

    - A chroot daemon can now indicate which part of its path should affect the
      chroot call, and which part should become an inside-chroot path for the
      module.  This allows you to have outside-the-transfer paths (such as for
      libraries) even when you enable chroot protection.  The idiom used in the
      rsyncd.conf file is:  path = /chroot/dirs/./dirs/inside

    - If a file's data arrived successfully on the receiving side but the
      rename of the temporary file to the destination file failed AND the
      --remove-source-files (or the deprecated --remove-sent-files) option
      was specified, rsync no longer erroneously removes the associated
      source file.

    - Fixed the output of -ii when combined with one of the --*-dest options:
      it now itemizes all the items, not just the changed ones.

    - Made the output of all file types consistent when using a --*-dest
      option.  Prior versions would output too many creation events for
      matching items.

    - The code that waits for a child pid now handles being interrupted by a
      signal.  This fixes a problem with the pre-xfer exec function not being
      able to get the exit status from the script.

    - A negated filter rule (i.e. with a '!' modifier) no longer loses the
      negation when sending the filter rules to the remote rsync.

    - Fixed a problem with the --out-format (aka --log-format) option %f:  it
      no longer outputs superfluous directory info for a non-daemon rsync.

    - Fixed a problem with -vv (double --verbose) and --stats when "pushing"
      files (which includes local copies).  Version 2.6.9 would complete the
      copy, but exit with an error when the receiver output its memory stats.

    - If --password-file is used on a non-daemon transfer, rsync now complains
      and exits.  This should help users figure out that they can't use this
      option to control a remote shell's password prompt.

    - Make sure that directory permissions of a newly-created destination
      directory are handled right when --perms is left off.

    - The itemized output of a newly-created destination directory is now
      output as a creation event, not a change event.

    - Improved --hard-link so that more corner cases are handled correctly
      when combined with options such as --link-dest and/or --ignore-existing.

    - The --append option no longer updates a file that has the same size.

    - Fixed a bug when combining --backup and --backup-dir with --inplace:
      any missing backup directories are now created.

    - Fixed a bug when using --backup and --inplace with --whole-file or
      --read-batch: backup files are actually created now.

    - The daemon pidfile is checked and created sooner in the startup sequence.

    - If a daemon module's "path" value is not an absolute pathname, the code
      now makes it absolute internally (making it work properly).

    - Ensure that a temporary file always has owner-write permission while we
      are writing to it.  This avoids problems with some network filesystems
      when transfering read-only files.

    - Any errors output about password-file reading no longer cause an error at
      the end of the run about a partial transfer.

    - The --read-batch option for protocol 30 now ensures that several more
      options are set correctly for the current batch file:  --iconv, --acls,
      --xattrs, --inplace, --append, and --append-verify.

    - Using --only-write-batch to a daemon receiver now works properly (older
      versions would update some files while writing the batch).

    - Avoid outputting a "file has vanished" message when the file is a broken
      symlink and --copy-unsafe-links or --copy-dirlinks is used (the code
      already handled this for --copy-links).

    - Fixed the combination of --only-write-batch and --dry-run.

    - Fixed rsync's ability to remove files that are not writable by the file's
      owner when rsync is running as the same user.

    - When transferring large files, the sender's hashtable of checksums is
      kept at a more reasonable state of fullness (no more than 80% full) so
      that the scanning of the hashtable will not bog down as the number of
      blocks increases.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - A new incremental-recursion algorithm is now used when rsync is talking
      to another 3.x version.  This starts the transfer going more quickly
      (before all the files have been found), and requires much less memory.
      See the --recursive option in the manpage for some restrictions.

    - Lowered memory use in the non-incremental-recursion algorithm for typical
      option values (usually saving from 21-29 bytes per file).

    - The default --delete algorithm is now --delete-during when talking to a
      3.x rsync.  This is a faster scan than using --delete-before (which is
      the default when talking to older rsync versions), and is compatible with
      the new incremental recursion mode.

    - Rsync now allows multiple remote-source args to be specified rather than
      having to rely on a special space-splitting side-effect of the remote-
      shell.  Additional remote args must specify the same host or an empty one
      (e.g. empty:  :file1  or  ::module/file2).  For example, this means that
      local use of brace expansion now works:  rsync -av host:dir/{f1,f2} .

    - Added the --protect-args (-s) option, that tells rsync to send most of
      the command-line args at the start of the transfer rather than as args
      to the remote-shell command.  This protects them from space-splitting,
      and only interprets basic wildcard special shell characters (*?[).

    - Added the --delete-delay option, which is a more efficient way to delete
      files at the end of the transfer without needing a separate delete pass.

    - Added the --acls (-A) option to preserve Access Control Lists.  This is
      an improved version of the prior patch that was available, and it even
      supports OS X ACLs.  If you need to have backward compatibility with old,
      ACL-patched versions of rsync, apply the acls.diff file from the patches
      dir.

    - Added the --xattrs (-X) option to preserve extended attributes.  This is
      an improved version of the prior patch that was available, and it even
      supports OS X xattrs (which includes their resource fork data).  If you
      need to have backward compatibility with old, xattr-patched versions of
      rsync, apply the xattrs.diff file from the patches dir.

    - Added the --fake-super option that allows a non-super user to preserve
      all attributes of a file by using a special extended-attribute idiom.
      It even supports the storing of foreign ACL data on your backup server.
      There is also an analogous "fake super" parameter for an rsync daemon.

    - Added the --iconv option, which allows rsync to convert filenames from
      one character-set to another during the transfer.  The default is to
      make this feature available as long as your system has iconv_open().
      If compilation fails, specify --disable-iconv to configure, and then
      rebuild.  If you want rsync to perform character-set conversions by
      default, you can specify --enable-iconv=CONVERT_STRING with the default
      value for the --iconv option that you wish to use.  For example,
      "--enable-iconv=." is a good choice.  See the rsync manpage for an
      explanation of the --iconv option's settings.

    - A new daemon config parameter, "charset", lets you control the character-
      set that is used during an --iconv transfer to/from a daemon module.  You
      can also set your daemon to refuse "no-iconv" if you want to force the
      client to use an --iconv transfer (requiring an rsync 3.x client).

    - Added the --skip-compress=LIST option to override the default list of
      file suffixes that will not be compressed when using --compress (-z).

    - The daemon's default for "dont compress" was extended to include:
	  *.7z *.mp[34] *.mov *.avi *.ogg *.jpg *.jpeg
      The name-matching routine was also optimized to run more quickly.

    - The --max-delete option now outputs a warning if it skipped any file
      deletions, including a count of how many deletions were skipped.  (Older
      versions just silently stopped deleting things.)

    - You may specify --max-delete=0 to a 3.0.0 client to request that it warn
      about extraneous files without deleting anything.  If you're not sure
      what version the client is, you can use the less-obvious --max-delete=-1,
      as both old and new versions will treat that as the same request (though
      older versions don't warn).

    - The --hard-link option now uses less memory on both the sending and
      receiving side for all protocol versions.  For protocol 30, the use of a
      hashtable on the sending side allows us to more efficiently convey to the
      receiver what files are linked together.  This reduces the amount of data
      sent over the socket by a considerable margin (rather than adding more
      data), and limits the in-memory storage of the device+inode information
      to just the sending side for the new protocol 30, or to the receiving
      side when speaking an older protocol (note that older rsync versions kept
      the device+inode information on both sides).

    - The filter rules now support a perishable ("p") modifier that marks rules
      that should not have an effect in a directory that is being deleted.  e.g.
      -f '-p .svn/' would only affect "live" .svn directories.

    - Rsync checks all the alternate-destination args for validity (e.g.
      --link-dest).  This lets the user know when they specified a directory
      that does not exist.

    - If we get an ENOSYS error setting the time on a symlink, we don't
      complain about it anymore (for those systems that even support the
      setting of the modify-time on a symlink).

    - Protocol 30 now uses MD5 checksums instead of MD4.

    - Changed the --append option to not checksum the existing data in the
      destination file, which speeds up file appending.

    - Added the --append-verify option, which works like the older --append
      option (verifying the existing data in the destination file).  For
      compatibility with older rsync versions, any use of --append that is
      talking protocol 29 or older will revert to the --append-verify method.

    - Added the --contimeout=SECONDS option that lets the user specify a
      connection timeout for rsync daemon access.

    - Documented and extended the support for the RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG variable
      that can be used to enhance the client side of a daemon connection.

    - Improved the dashes and double-quotes in the nroff manpage output.

    - Rsync now supports a lot more --no-OPTION override options.

  INTERNAL:

    - The file-list sorting algorithm now uses a sort that keeps any same-
      named items in the same order as they were specified.  This allows
      rsync to always ensure that the first of the duplicates is the one
      that will be included in the copy.  The new sort is also faster
      than the glibc version of qsort() and mergesort().

    - Rsync now supports the transfer of 64-bit timestamps (time_t values).

    - Made the file-deletion code use a little less stack when recursing
      through a directory hierarchy of extraneous files.

    - Fixed a build problem with older (2.x) versions of gcc.

    - Added some isType() functions that make dealing with signed characters
      easier without forcing variables via casts.

    - Changed strcat/strcpy/sprintf function calls to use safer versions.

    - Upgraded the included popt version to 1.10.2 and improved its use of
      string-handling functions.

    - Added missing prototypes for compatibility functions from the lib dir.

    - Configure determines if iconv() has a const arg, allowing us to avoid a
      compiler warning.

    - Made the sending of some numbers more efficient for protocol 30.

    - Make sure that a daemon process doesn't mind if the client was weird and
      omitted the --server option.

    - There are more internal logging categories available in protocol 30 than
      the age-old FINFO and FERROR, including FERROR_XFER and FWARN.  These new
      categories allow some errors and warnings to go to stderr without causing
      an erroneous end-of-run warning about some files not being able to be
      transferred.

    - Improved the use of "const" on pointers.

    - Improved J.W.'s pool_alloc routines to add a way of incrementally freeing
      older sections of a pool's memory.

    - The getaddrinfo.c compatibility code in the "lib" dir was replaced with
      some new code (derived from samba, derived from PostgreSQL) that has a
      better license than the old code.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Rsync is now licensed under the GPLv3 or later.

    - Rsync is now being maintained in a "git" repository instead of CVS
      (though the old CVS repository still exists for historical access).
      Several maintenance scripts were updated to work with git.

    - Generated files are no longer committed into the source repository.  The
      autoconf and autoheader commands are now automatically run during the
      normal use of "configure" and "make".  The latest dev versions of all
      generated files can also be copied from the samba.org web site (see the
      prepare-source script's fetch option).

    - The "patches" directory of diff files is now built from branches in the
      rsync git repository (branch patch/FOO creates file patches/FOO.diff).
      This directory is now distributed in a separate separate tar file named
      rsync-patches-VERSION.tar.gz instead of the main rsync-VERSION.tar.gz.

    - The proto.h file is now built using a simple perl script rather than a
      complex awk script, which proved to be more widely compatible.

    - When running the tests, we now put our per-test temp dirs into a sub-
      directory named testtmp (which is created, if missing).  This allows
      someone to symlink the testtmp directory to another filesystem (which is
      useful if the build dir's filesystem does not support ACLs and xattrs,
      but another filesystem does).

    - Rsync now has a way of handling protocol-version changes during the
      development of a new protocol version.  This causes any out-of-sync
      versions to speak an older protocol rather than fail in a cryptic manner.
      This addition makes it safer to deploy a pre-release version that may
      interact with the public.  This new exchange of sub-version info does not
      interfere with the {MIN,MAX}_PROTOCOL_VERSION checking algorithm (which
      does not have enough range to allow the main protocol number to be
      incremented for every minor tweak in that happens during development).

    - The csprotocol.txt file was updated to mention the daemon protocol change
      in the 3.0.0 release.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.9 (6 Nov 2006)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.8:

  BUG FIXES:

    - If rsync is interrupted via a handled signal (such as SIGINT), it will
      once again clean-up its temp file from the destination dir.

    - Fixed an overzealous sanitizing bug in the handling of the --link-dest,
      --copy-dest, and --compare-dest options to a daemon without chroot: if
      the copy's destination dir is deeper than the top of the module's path,
      these options now accept a safe number of parent-dir (../) references
      (since these options are relative to the destination dir).  The old code
      incorrectly chopped off all "../" prefixes for these options, no matter
      how deep the destination directory was in the module's hierarchy.

    - Fixed a bug where a deferred info/error/log message could get sent
      directly to the sender instead of being handled by rwrite() in the
      generator.  This fixes an "unexpected tag 3" fatal error, and should
      also fix a potential problem where a deferred info/error message from
      the receiver might bypass the log file and get sent only to the client
      process.  (These problems could only affect an rsync daemon that was
      receiving files.)

    - Fixed a bug when --inplace was combined with a --*-dest option and we
      update a file's data using an alternate basis file.  The code now
      notices that it needs to copy the matching data from the basis file
      instead of (wrongly) assuming that it was already present in the file.

    - Fixed a bug where using --dry-run with a --*-dest option with a path
      relative to a directory that does not yet exist:  the affected option
      gets its proper path value so that the output of the dry-run is right.

    - Fixed a bug in the %f logfile escape when receiving files: the
      destination path is now included in the output (e.g. you can now tell
      when a user specifies a subdir inside a module).

    - If the receiving side fails to create a directory, it will now skip
      trying to update everything that is inside that directory.

    - If --link-dest is specified with --checksum but without --times, rsync
      will now allow a hard-link to be created to a matching link-dest file
      even when the file's modify-time doesn't match the server's file.

    - The daemon now calls more timezone-using functions prior to doing a
      chroot.  This should help some C libraries to generate proper timestamps
      from inside a chrooted daemon (and to not try to access /etc/timezone
      over and over again).

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of an absolute --partial-dir=ABS_PATH option:
      it now deletes an alternate basis file from the partial-dir that was used
      to successfully update a destination file.

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of --delete-excluded when using a per-dir
      merge file:  the merge file is now honored on the receiving side, and
      only its unqualified include/exclude commands are ignored (just as is
      done for global include/excludes).

    - Fixed a recent bug where --delete was not working when transferring from
      the root (/) of the filesystem with --relative enabled.

    - Fixed a recent bug where an --exclude='*' could affect the root (/) of
      the filesystem with --relative enabled.

    - When --inplace creates a file, it is now created with owner read/write
      permissions (0600) instead of no permissions at all.  This avoids a
      problem continuing a transfer that was interrupted (since --inplace
      will not update a file that has no write permissions).

    - If either --remove-source-files or --remove-sent-files is enabled and we
      are unable to remove the source file, rsync now outputs an error.

    - Fixed a bug in the daemon's "incoming chmod" rule:  newly-created
      directories no longer get the 'F' (file) rules applied to them.

    - Fixed an infinite loop bug when a filter rule was rejected due to being
      overly long.

    - When the server receives a --partial-dir option from the client, it no
      longer runs the client-side code that adds an assumed filter rule (since
      the client will be sending us the rules in the usual manner, and they
      may have chosen to override the auto-added rule).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --log-file=FILE and --log-file-format=FORMAT options.  These
      can be used to tell any rsync to output what it is doing to a log file.
      They work with a client rsync, a non-daemon server rsync (see the man
      page for instructions), and also allows the overriding of rsyncd.conf
      settings when starting a daemon.

    - The --log-format option was renamed to be --out-format to avoid confusing
      it with affecting the log-file output.  (The old option remains as an
      alias for the new to preserve backward compatibility.)

    - Made "log file" and "syslog facility" settable on a per-module basis in
      the daemon's config file.

    - Added the --remove-source-files option as a replacement for the (now
      deprecated) --remove-sent-files option.  This new option removes all
      non-dirs from the source directories, even if the file was already
      up-to-date.  This fixes a problem where interrupting an rsync that
      was using --remove-sent-files and restarting it could leave behind
      a file that the earlier rsync synchronized, but didn't get to remove.
      (The deprecated --remove-sent-files is still understood for now, and
      still behaves in the same way as before.)

    - Added the option --no-motd to suppress the message-of-the-day output
      from a daemon when doing a copy.  (See the manpage for a caveat.)

    - Added a new environment variable to the pre-/post-xfer exec commands (in
      the daemon's config file):  RSYNC_PID.  This value will be the same in
      both the pre- and post-xfer commands, so it can be used as a unique ID
      if the pre-xfer command wants to cache some arg/request info for the
      post-xfer command.

  INTERNAL:

    - Did a code audit using IBM's code-checker program and made several
      changes, including: replacing most of the strcpy() and sprintf()
      calls with strlcpy(), snprintf(), and memcpy(), adding a 0-value to
      an enum that had been intermingling a literal 0 with the defined enum
      values, silencing some uninitialized memory checks, marking some
      functions with a "noreturn" attribute, and changing an "if" that
      could never succeed on some platforms into a pre-processor directive
      that conditionally compiles the code.

    - Fixed a potential bug in f_name_cmp() when both the args are a
      top-level "." dir (which doesn't happen in normal operations).

    - Changed exit_cleanup() so that it can never return instead of exit.
      The old code might return if it found the exit_cleanup() function
      was being called recursively.  The new code is segmented so that
      any recursive calls move on to the next step of the exit-processing.

    - The macro WIFEXITED(stat) will now be defined if the OS didn't already
      define it.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The acls.diff and xattrs.diff patches have received a bunch of work to
      make them much closer to being acceptable in the main distribution.
      The xattrs patch also has some preliminary Mac OS X and FreeBSD
      compatibility code that various system types to exchange extended
      file-attributes.

    - A new diff in the patches dir, fake-root.diff, allows rsync to
      maintain a backup hierarchy with full owner, group, and device info
      without actually running as root.  It does this using a special
      extended attribute, so it depends on xattrs.diff (which depends on
      acls.diff).

    - The rsync.yo and rsyncd.conf.yo files have been updated to work
      better with the latest yodl 2.x releases.

    - Updated config.guess and config.sub to their 2006-07-02 versions.

    - Updated various files to include the latest FSF address and to have
      consistent opening comments.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.8 (22 Apr 2006)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.7:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bug in the exclude code where an anchored exclude without any
      wildcards fails to match an absolute source arg, but only when --relative
      is in effect.

    - Improved the I/O code for the generator to fix a potential hang when the
      receiver gets an EOF on the socket but the generator's select() call
      never indicates that the socket is writable for it to be notified about
      the EOF.  (This can happen when using stunnel).

    - Fixed a problem with the file-reading code where a failed read (such as
      that caused by a bad sector) would not advance the file's read-position
      beyond the failed read's data.

    - Fixed a logging bug where the "log file" directive was not being honored
      in a single-use daemon (one spawned by a remote-shell connection or by
      init).

    - If rsync cannot honor the --delete option, we output an error and exit
      instead of silently ignoring the option.

    - Fixed a bug in the --link-dest code that prevented special files (such as
      fifos) from being linked.

    - The ability to hard-link symlinks and special files is now determined at
      configure time instead of at runtime.  This fixes a bug with --link-dest
      creating a hard-link to a symlink's referent on a BSD system.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - In daemon mode, if rsync fails to bind to the requested port, the
      error(s) returned by socket() and/or bind() are now logged.

    - When we output a fatal error, we now output the version of rsync in the
      message.

    - Improved the documentation for the --owner and --group options.

    - The rsyncstats script in "support" has an improved line-parsing regex
      that is easier to read and also makes it to parse syslog-generated lines.

    - A new script in "support": file-attr-restore, can be used to restore the
      attributes of a file-set (the permissions, ownership, and group info)
      taken from the cached output of a "find ARG... -ls" command.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Removed the unused function write_int_named(), the unused variable
      io_read_phase, and the rarely used variable io_write_phase.  This also
      elides the confusing 'phase "unknown"' part of one error message.

    - Removed two unused configure checks and two related (also unused)
      compatibility functions.

    - The xattrs.diff patch received a security fix that prevents a potential
      buffer overflow in the receive_xattr() code.

    - The acls.diff patch has been improved quite a bit, with more to come.

    - A new patch was added: log-file.diff.  This contains an early version of
      a future option, --log-file=FILE, that will allow any rsync to log its
      actions to a file (something that only a daemon supports at present).


NEWS for rsync 2.6.7 (11 Mar 2006)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.6:

  OUTPUT CHANGES:

    - The letter 'D' in the itemized output was being used for both devices
      (character or block) as well as other special files (such as fifos and
      named sockets).  This has changed to separate non-device special files
      under the 'S' designation (e.g. "cS+++++++ path/fifo").  See also the
      "--specials" option, below.

    - The way rsync escapes unreadable characters has changed.  First, rsync
      now has support for recognizing valid multibyte character sequences in
      your current locale, allowing it to escape fewer characters than before
      for a locale such as UTF-8.  Second, it now uses an escape idiom of
      "\#123", which is the literal string "\#" followed by exactly 3 octal
      digits.  Rsync no longer doubles a backslash character in a filename
      (e.g. it used to output "foo\\bar" when copying "foo\bar") -- now it only
      escapes a backslash that is followed by a hash-sign and 3 digits (0-9)
      (e.g. it will output "foo\#134#789" when copying "foo\#789").  See also
      the --8-bit-output (-8) option, mentioned below.

      Script writers: the local rsync is the one that outputs escaped names,
      so if you need to support unescaping of filenames for older rsyncs, I'd
      suggest that you parse the output of "rsync --version" and only use the
      old unescaping rules for 2.6.5 and 2.6.6.

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a really old bug that caused --checksum (-c) to checksum all the
      files encountered during the delete scan (ouch).

    - Fixed a potential hang in a remote generator:  when the receiver gets a
      read-error on the socket, it now signals the generator about this so that
      the generator does not try to send any of the terminating error messages
      to the client (avoiding a potential hang in some setups).

    - Made hard-links work with symlinks and devices again.

    - If the sender gets an early EOF reading a source file, we propagate this
      error to the receiver so that it can discard the file and try requesting
      it again (which is the existing behavior for other kinds of read errors).

    - If a device-file/special-file changes permissions, rsync now updates the
      permissions without recreating the file.

    - If the user specifies a remote-host for both the source and destination,
      we now output a syntax error rather than trying to open the destination
      hostspec as a filename.

    - When --inplace creates a new destination file, rsync now creates it with
      permissions 0600 instead of 0000 -- this makes restarting possible when
      the transfer gets interrupted in the middle of sending a new file.

    - Reject the combination of --inplace and --sparse since the sparse-output
      algorithm doesn't work when overwriting existing data.

    - Fixed the directory name in the error that is output when pop_dir()
      fails.

    - Really fixed the parsing of a "!" entry in .cvsignore files this time.

    - If the generator gets a stat() error on a file, output it (this used to
      require at least -vv for the error to be seen).

    - If waitpid() fails or the child rsync didn't exit cleanly, we now handle
      the exit status properly and generate a better error.

    - Fixed some glitches in the double-verbose output when using --copy-dest,
      --link-dest, or --compare-dest.  Also improved how the verbose output
      handles hard-links (within the transfer) that had an up-to-date alternate
      "dest" file, and copied files (via --copy-dest).

    - Fixed the matching of the dont-compress items (e.g. *.gz) against files
      that have a path component containing a slash.

    - If the code reading a filter/exclude file gets an EINTR error, rsync now
      clears the error flag on the file handle so it can keep on reading.

    - If --relative is active, the sending side cleans up trailing "/" or "/."
      suffixes to avoid triggering a bug in older rsync versions.  Also, we now
      reject a ".." dir if it would be sent as a relative dir.

    - If a non-directory is in the way of a directory and rsync is run with
      --dry-run and --delete, rsync no longer complains about not being able
      to opendir() the not-yet present directory.

    - When --list-only is used and a non-existent local destination dir was
      also specified as a destination, rsync no longer generates a warning
      about being unable to create the missing directory.

    - Fixed some problems with --relative --no-implied-dirs when the
      destination directory did not yet exist:  we can now create a symlink or
      device when it is the first thing in the missing dir, and --fuzzy no
      longer complains about being unable to open the missing dir.

    - Fixed a bug where the --copy-links option would not affect implied
      directories without --copy-unsafe-links (see --relative).

    - Got rid of the need for --force to be used in some circumstances with
      --delete-after (making it consistent with --delete-before/-during).

    - Rsync now ignores the SIGXFSZ signal, just in case your OS sends this
      when a file is too large (rsync handles the write error).

    - Fixed a bug in the Proxy-Authorization header's base64-encoded value: it
      was not properly padded with trailing '=' chars.  This only affects a
      user that need to use a password-authenticated proxy for an outgoing
      daemon-rsync connection.

    - If we're transferring an empty directory to a new name, rsync no longer
      forces S_IWUSR if it wasn't already set, nor does it accidentally leave
      it set.

    - Fixed a bug in the debug output (-vvvvv) that could mention the wrong
      checksum for the current file offset.

    - Rsync no longer allows a single directory to be copied over a non-
      directory destination arg.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --append option that makes rsync append data onto files that
      are longer on the source than the destination (this includes new files).

    - Added the --min-size=SIZE option to exclude small files from the
      transfer.

    - Added the --compress-level option to allow you to set how aggressive
      rsync's compression should be (this option implies --compress).

    - Enhanced the parsing of the SIZE value for --min-size and --max-size to
      allow easy entry of multiples of 1000 (instead of just multiples of 1024)
      and off-by-one values too (e.g. --max-size=8mb-1).

    - Added the --8-bit-output (-8) option, which tells rsync to avoid escaping
      high-bit characters that it thinks are unreadable in the current locale.

    - The new option --human-readable (-h) changes the output of --progress,
      --stats, and the end-of-run summary to be easier to read.  If repeated,
      the units become powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.  (The old
      meaning of -h, as a shorthand for --help, still works as long as you
      just use it on its own, as in "rsync -h".)

    - If lutimes() and/or lchmod() are around, use them to allow the
      preservation of attributes on symlinks.

    - The --link-dest option now affects symlinks and devices (when possible).

    - Added two config items to the rsyncd.conf parsing:  "pre-xfer exec" and
      "post-xfer exec".  These allow a command to be specified on a per-module
      basis that will be run before and/or after a daemon-mode transfer.  (See
      the man page for a list of the environment variables that are set with
      information about the transfer.)

    - When using the --relative option, you can now insert a dot dir in
      the source path to indicate where the replication of the source dirs
      should start.  For example, if you specify a source path of
      rsync://host/module/foo/bar/./baz/dir with -R, rsync will now only
      replicate the "baz/dir" part of the source path (note: a trailing
      dot dir is unaffected unless it also has a trailing slash).

    - Added some new --no-FOO options that make it easier to override unwanted
      implied or default options.  For example, "-a --no-o" (aka "--archive
      --no-owner") can be used to turn off the preservation of file ownership
      that is implied by -a.

    - Added the --chmod=MODE option that allows the destination permissions to
      be changed from the source permissions.  E.g. --chmod=g+w,o-rwx

    - Added the "incoming chmod" and "outgoing chmod" daemon options that allow
      a module to specify what permissions changes should be applied to all
      files copied to and from the daemon.

    - Allow the --temp-dir option to be specified when starting a daemon, which
      sets the default temporary directory for incoming files.

    - If --delete is combined with --dirs without --recursive, rsync will now
      delete in any directory whose content is being synchronized.

    - If --backup is combined with --delete without --backup-dir (and without
      --delete-excluded), we add a "protect" filter-rule to ensure that files
      with the backup suffix are not deleted.

    - The file-count stats that are output by --progress were improved to
      better indicate what the numbers mean.  For instance, the output:
      "(xfer#5, to-check=8383/9999)" indicates that this was the fifth file
      to be transferred, and we still need to check 8383 more files out of
      a total of 9999.

    - The include/exclude code now allows a dir/*** directive (with 3 trailing
      stars) to match both the dir itself as well as all the content below the
      dir (dir/** would not match the dir).

    - Added the --prune-empty-dirs (-m) option that makes the receiving rsync
      discard empty chains of directories from the file-list.  This makes it
      easier to selectively copy files from a source hierarchy and end up with
      just the directories needed to hold the resulting files.

    - If the --itemize-changes (-i) option is repeated, rsync now includes
      unchanged files in the itemized output (similar to -vv, but without all
      the other verbose messages that can get in the way).  Of course, the
      client must be version 2.6.7 for this to work, but the remote rsync only
      needs to be 2.6.7 if you're pushing files.

    - Added the --specials option to tell rsync to copy non-device special
      files (which rsync now attempts even as a normal user).  The --devices
      option now requests the copying of just devices (character and block).
      The -D option still requests both (e.g. --devices and --specials), -a
      still implies -D, and non-root users still get a silent downgrade that
      omits device copying.

    - Added the --super option to make the receiver always attempt super-user
      activities.  This is useful for systems that allow things such as devices
      to be created or ownership to be set without being UID 0, and is also
      useful for someone who wants to ensure that errors will be output if the
      receiving rsync isn't being run as root.

    - Added the --sockopts option for those few who want to customize the TCP
      options used to contact a daemon rsync.

    - Added a way for the --temp-dir option to be combined with a partial-dir
      setting that lets rsync avoid non-atomic updates (for those times when
      --temp-dir is not being used because space is tight).

    - A new support script, files-to-excludes, will transform a list of files
      into a set of include/exclude directives that will copy those files.

    - A new option, --executability (-E) can be used to preserve just the
      execute bit on files, for those times when using the --perms option is
      not desired.

    - The daemon now logs each connection and also each module-list request
      that it receives.

    - New log-format options: %M (modtime), %U (uid), %G (gid), and %B
      (permission bits, e.g. "rwxr-xrwt").

    - The --dry-run option no longer forces the enabling of --verbose.

    - The --remove-sent-files option now does a better job of incrementally
      removing the sent files on the sending side (older versions tended to
      clump up all the removals at the end).

    - A daemon now supersedes its minimal SIGCHLD handler with the standard
      PID-remembering version after forking.  This ensures that the generator
      can get the child-exit status from the receiver.

    - Use of the --bwlimit option no longer interferes with the remote rsync
      sending error messages about invalid/refused options.

    - Rsync no longer returns a usage error when used with one local source arg
      and no destination: this now implies the --list-only option, just like
      the comparable situation with a remote source arg.

    - Added the --copy-dirlinks option, a more limited version of --copy-links.

    - Various documentation improvements, including: a better synopsis, some
      improved examples, a better discussion of the presence and absence of
      --perms (including how it interacts with the new --executability and
      --chmod options), an extended discussion of --temp-dir, an improved
      discussion of --partial-dir, a better description of rsync's pattern
      matching characters, an improved --no-implied-dirs section, and the
      documenting of what the --stats option outputs.

    - Various new and updated diffs in the patches dir, including: acls.diff,
      xattrs.diff, atimes.diff, detect-renamed.diff, and slp.diff.

  INTERNAL:

    - We now use sigaction() and sigprocmask() if possible, and fall back on
      signal() if not.  Using sigprocmask() ensures that rsync enables all the
      signals that it needs, just in case it was started in a masked state.

    - Some buffer sizes were expanded a bit, particularly on systems where
      MAXPATHLEN is overly small (e.g. cygwin).

    - If io_printf() tries to format more data than fits in the buffer, exit
      with an error instead of transmitting a truncated buffer.

    - If a va_copy macro is defined, lib/snprintf.c will use it when defining
      the VA_COPY macro.

    - Reduced the amount of stack memory needed for each level of directory
      recursion by nearly MAXPATHLEN bytes.

    - The wildmatch function was extended to allow an array of strings to be
      supplied as the string to match.  This allows the exclude code to do less
      string copying.

    - Got rid of the safe_fname() function (and all the myriad calls) and
      replaced it with a new function in the log.c code that filters all the
      output going to the terminal.

    - Unified the f_name() and the f_name_to() functions.

    - Improved the hash-table code the sender uses to handle checksums to make
      it use slightly less memory and run just a little faster.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The diffs in the patches dir now require "patch -p1 <DIFF" instead of
      the previous -p0.  Also, the version included in the release tar now
      affect generated files (e.g. configure, rsync.1, proto.h, etc.), so
      it is no longer necessary to run autoconf and/or yodl unless you're
      applying a patch that was checked out from CVS.

    - Several diffs in the patches dir now use the proper --enable-FOO
      configure option instead of --with-FOO to turn on the inclusion of
      the newly patched feature.

    - There is a new script, "prepare-source" than can be used to update the
      various generated files (proto.h, configure, etc.) even before configure
      has created the Makefile (this is mainly useful when patching the source
      with a patch that doesn't affect generated files).

    - The testsuite now sets HOME so that it won't be affected by a file such
      as ~/.popt.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.6 (28 Jul 2005)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.5:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    - The zlib code was upgraded to version 1.2.3 in order to make it more
      secure.  While the widely-publicized security problem in zlib 1.2.2 did
      not affect rsync, another security problem surfaced that affects rsync's
      zlib 1.1.4.

  BUG FIXES:

    - The setting of flist->high in clean_flist() was wrong for an empty list.
      This could cause flist_find() to crash in certain rare circumstances
      (e.g. if just the right directory setup was around when --fuzzy was
      combined with --link-dest).

    - The outputting of hard-linked files when verbosity was > 1 was not right:
      (1) Without -i it would output the name of each hard-linked file as
      though it had been changed; it now outputs a "is hard linked" message for
      the file. (2) With -i it would output all dots for the unchanged
      attributes of a hard-link; it now changes those dots to spaces, as is
      done for other totally unchanged items.

    - When backing up a changed symlink or device, get rid of any old backup
      item so that we don't get an "already exists" error.

    - A couple places that were comparing a local and a remote modification-
      time were not honoring the --modify-window option.

    - Fixed a bug where the 'p' (permissions) itemized-changes flag might get
      set too often (if some non-significant mode bits differed).

    - Fixed a really old, minor bug that could cause rsync to warn about being
      unable to mkdir() a path that ends in "/." because it just created the
      directory (required --relative, --no-implied-dirs, a source path that
      ended in either a trailing slash or a trailing "/.", and a non-existing
      destination dir to tickle the bug in a recent version).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Made the "max verbosity" setting in the rsyncd.conf file settable on a
      per-module basis (which now matches the documentation).

    - The support/rrsync script has been upgraded to verify the args of options
      that take args (instead of rejecting any such options).  The script was
      also changed to try to be more secure and to fix a problem in the parsing
      of a pull operation that has multiple sources.

    - Improved the documentation that explains the difference between a
      normal daemon transfer and a daemon-over remote-shell transfer.

    - Some of the diffs supplied in the patches dir were fixed and/or
      improved.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Made configure define NOBODY_USER (currently hard-wired to "nobody") and
      NOBODY_GROUP (set to either "nobody" or "nogroup" depending on what we
      find in the /etc/group file).

    - Added a test to the test suite, itemized.test, that tests the output of
      -i (log-format w/%i) and some double-verbose messages.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.5 (1 Jun 2005)
Protocol: 29 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.4:

  OUTPUT CHANGES:

    - Non-printable chars in filenames are now output using backslash-
      escaped characters rather than '?'s.  Any non-printable character is
      output using 3 digits of octal (e.g. "\n" -> "\012"), and a backslash
      is now output as "\\".  Rsync also uses your locale setting, which
      can make it treat fewer high-bit characters as non-printable.

    - If rsync received an empty file-list when pulling files, it would
      output a "nothing to do" message and exit with a 0 (success) exit
      status, even if the remote rsync returned an error (it did not do
      this under the same conditions when pushing files).  This was changed
      to make the pulling behavior the same as the pushing behavior:  we
      now do the normal end-of-run outputting (depending on options) and
      exit with the appropriate exit status.

  BUG FIXES:

    - A crash bug was fixed when a daemon had its "path" set to "/", did
      not have chroot enabled, and used some anchored excludes in the
      rsyncd.conf file.

    - Fixed a bug in the transfer of a single file when -H is specified
      (rsync would either infinite loop or perhaps crash).

    - Fixed a case where the generator might try (and fail) to tweak the
      write-permissions of a read-only directory in list-only mode (this
      only caused an annoying warning message).

    - If --compare-dest or --link-dest uses a locally-copied file as the
      basis for an updated version, log this better when --verbose or -i
      is in effect.

    - Fixed the accidental disabling of --backup during the --delete-after
      processing.

    - Restored the ability to use the --address option in client mode (in
      addition to its use in daemon mode).

    - Make sure that some temporary progress information from the delete
      processing does not get left on the screen when it is followed by a
      newline.

    - When --existing skips a directory with extra verbosity, refer to it
      as a "directory", not a "file".

    - When transferring a single file to a different-named file, any
      generator messages that are source-file related no longer refer to
      the file by the destination filename.

    - Fixed a bug where hard-linking a group of files might fail if the
      generator hasn't created a needed destination directory yet.

    - Fixed a bug where a hard-linked group of files that is newly-linked
      to a file in a --link-dest dir doesn't link the files from the rest
      of the cluster.

    - When deleting files with the --one-file-system (-x) option set, rsync
      no longer tries to remove files from inside a mount-point on the
      receiving side.  Also, we don't complain about being unable to remove
      the mount-point dir.

    - Fixed a compatibility problem when using --cvs-ignore (-C) and
      sending files to an older rsync without using --delete.

    - Make sure that a "- !" or "+ !" include/exclude pattern does not
      trigger the list-clearing action that is reserved for "!".

    - Avoid a timeout in the generator when the sender/receiver aren't
      handling the generator's checksum output quickly enough.

    - Fixed the omission of some directories in the delete processing when
      --relative (-R) was combined with a source path that had a trailing
      slash.

    - Fixed a case where rsync would erroneously delete some files and then
      re-transfer them when the options --relative (-R) and --recursive
      (-r) were both enabled (along with --delete) and a source path had a
      trailing slash.

    - Make sure that --max-size doesn't affect a device or a symlink.

    - Make sure that a system with a really small MAXPATHLEN does not cause
      the buffers in readfd_unbuffered() to be too small to receive normal
      messages.  (This mainly affected Cygwin.)

    - If a source pathname ends with a filename of "..", treat it as if
      "../" had been specified (so that we don't copy files to the parent
      dir of the destination).

    - If --delete is combined with a file-listing rsync command (i.e. no
      transfer is happening), avoid outputting a warning that we couldn't
      delete anything.

    - If --stats is specified with --delete-after, ensure that all the
      "deleting" messages are output before the statistics.

    - Improved one "if" in the deletion code that was only checking errno
      for ENOTEMPTY when it should have also been checking for EEXIST (for
      compatibility with OS variations).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --only-write-batch=FILE option that may be used (instead
      of --write-batch=FILE) to create a batch file without doing any
      actual updating of the destination.  This allows you to divert all
      the file-updating data away from a slow data link (as long as you
      are pushing the data to the remote server when creating the batch).

    - When the generator is taking a long time to fill up its output buffer
      (e.g. if the transferred files are few, small, or missing), it now
      periodically flushes the output buffer so that the sender/receiver
      can get started on the files sooner rather than later.

    - Improved the keep-alive code to handle a long silence between the
      sender and the receiver that can occur when the sender is receiving
      the checksum data for a large file.

    - Improved the auth-errors that are logged by the daemon to include
      some information on why the authorization failed:  wrong user,
      password mismatch, etc.  (The client-visible message is unchanged!)

    - Improved the client's handling of an "@ERROR" from a daemon so that
      it does not complain about an unexpectedly closed socket (since we
      really did expect the socket to close).

    - If the daemon can't open the log-file specified in rsyncd.conf, fall
      back to using syslog and log an appropriate warning.  This is better
      than what was typically a totally silent (and fatal) failure (since a
      daemon is not usually run with the --no-detach option that was
      necessary to see the error on stderr).

    - The man pages now consistently refer to an rsync daemon as a "daemon"
      instead of a "server" (to distinguish it from the server process in a
      non-daemon transfer).

    - Made a small change to the rrsync script (restricted rsync -- in the
      support dir) to make a read-only server reject all --remove-* options
      when sending files (to future-proof it against the possibility of
      other similar options being added at some point).

  INTERNAL:

    - Rsync now calls setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "").  This enables isprint() to
      better discern which filename characters need to be escaped in
      messages (which should result in fewer escaped characters in some
      locales).

    - Improved the naming of the log-file open/reopen/close functions.

    - Removed some protocol-compatibility code that was only needed to help
      someone running a pre-release of 2.6.4.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Added configure option "--disable-locale" to disable any use of
      setlocale() in the binary.

    - Fixed a bug in the SUPPORT{,_HARD}_LINKS #defines which prevented
      rsync from being built without symlink or hard-link support.

    - Only #define HAVE_REMSH if it is going to be set to 1.

    - Configure now disables the use of mkstemp() under HP-UX (since they
      refuse to fix its broken handling of large files).

    - Configure now explicitly checks for the lseek64() function so that
      the code can use HAVE_LSEEK64 instead of inferring lseek64()'s
      presence based on the presence of the off64_t type.

    - Configure no longer mentions the change in the default remote-shell
      (from rsh to ssh) that occurred for the 2.6.0 release.

    - Some minor enhancements to the test scripts.

    - Added a few new *.diff files to the patches dir, including a patch
      that enables the optional copying of extended attributes.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.4 (30 March 2005)
Protocol: 29 (changed)
Changes since 2.6.3:

  OUTPUT CHANGES:

    - When rsync deletes a directory and outputs a verbose message about
      it, it now appends a trailing slash to the name instead of (only
      sometimes) outputting a preceding "directory " string.

    - The --stats output will contain file-list time-statistics if both
      sides are 2.6.4, or if the local side is 2.6.4 and the files are
      being pushed (since the stats come from the sending side).
      (Requires protocol 29 for a pull.)

    - The "%o" (operation) log-format escape now has a third value (besides
      "send" and "recv"):  "del." (with trailing dot to make it 4 chars).
      This changes the way deletions are logged in the daemon's log file.

    - When the --log-format option is combined with --verbose, rsync now
      avoids outputting the name of the file twice in most circumstances.
      As long as the --log-format item does not refer to any post-transfer
      items (such as %b or %c), the --log-format message is output prior to
      the transfer, so --verbose is now the equivalent of a --log-format of
      '%n%L' (which outputs the name and any link info).  If the log output
      must occur after the transfer to be complete, the only time the name
      is also output prior to the transfer is when --progress was specified
      (so that the name will precede the progress stats, and the full
      --log-format output will come after).

    - Non-printable characters in filenames are replaced with a '?' to
      avoid corrupting the screen or generating empty lines in the output.
  
  BUG FIXES:

    - Restore the list-clearing behavior of "!" in a .cvsignore file (2.6.3
      was only treating it as a special token in an rsync include/exclude
      file).

    - The combination of --verbose and --dry-run now mentions the full list
      of changes that would be output without --dry-run.

    - Avoid a mkdir warning when removing a directory in the destination
      that already exists in the --backup-dir.

    - An OS that has a binary mode for its files (such as cygwin) needed
      setmode(fd, O_BINARY) called on the temp-file we opened with
      mkstemp().  (Fix derived from cygwin's 2.6.3 rsync package.)

    - Fixed a potential hang when verbosity is high, the client side is
      the sender, and the file-list is large.

    - Fixed a potential protocol-corrupting bug where the generator could
      merge a message from the receiver into the middle of a multiplexed
      packet of data if only part of that data had been written out to the
      socket when the message from the generator arrived.

    - We now check if the OS doesn't support using mknod() for creating
      FIFOs and sockets, and compile-in some compatibility code using
      mkfifo() and socket() when necessary.

    - Fixed an off-by-one error in the handling of --max-delete=N.  Also,
      if the --max-delete limit is exceeded during a run, we now output a
      warning about this at the end of the run and exit with a new error
      code (25).

    - One place in the code wasn't checking if fork() failed.

    - The "ignore nonreadable" daemon parameter used to erroneously affect
      readable symlinks that pointed to a non-existent file.

    - If the OS does not have lchown() and a chown() of a symlink will
      affect the referent of a symlink (as it should), we no longer try
      to set the user and group of a symlink.

    - The generator now properly runs the hard-link loop and the dir-time
      rewriting loop after we're sure that the redo phase is complete.

    - When --backup was specified with --partial-dir=DIR, where DIR is a
      relative path, the backup code was erroneously trying to backup a
      file that was put into the partial-dir.

    - If a file gets resent in a single transfer and the --backup option is
      enabled along with --inplace, rsync no longer performs a duplicate
      backup (it used to overwrite the first backup with the failed file).

    - One call to flush_write_file() was not being checked for an error.

    - The --no-relative option was not being sent from the client to a
      server sender.

    - If an rsync daemon specified "dont compress = ..." for a file and the
      client tried to specify --compress, the libz code was not handling a
      compression level of 0 properly.  This could cause a transfer failure
      if the block-size for a file was large enough (e.g. rsync might have
      exited with an error for large files).

    - Fixed a bug that would sometimes surface when using --compress and
      sending a file with a block-size larger than 64K (either manually
      specified, or computed due to the file being really large).  Prior
      versions of rsync would sometimes fail to decompress the data
      properly, and thus the transferred file would fail its verification.

    - If a daemon can't open the specified log file (i.e. syslog is not
      being used), die without crashing.  We also output an error about
      the failure on stderr (which will only be seen if --no-detach was
      specified) and exit with a new error code (6).

    - A local transfer no longer duplicates all its include/exclude options
      (since the forked process already has a copy of the exclude list,
      there's no need to send them a set of duplicates).

    - The output of the items that are being updated by the generator (dirs,
      symlinks, devices) is now intermingled in the proper order with the
      output from the items that the receiver is updating (regular files)
      when pulling.  This misordering was particularly bad when --progress
      was specified.  (Requires protocol 29.)

    - When --timeout is specified, lulls that occur in the transfer while
      the generator is doing work that does not generate socket traffic
      (looking for changed files, deleting files, doing directory-time
      touch-ups, etc.) will cause a new keep-alive packet to be sent that
      should keep the transfer going as long as the generator continues to
      make progress.  (Requires protocol 29.)

    - The stat size of a device is not added to the total file size of the
      items in the transfer (the size might be undefined on some OSes).

    - Fixed a problem with refused-option messages sometimes not making it
      back to the client side when a remote --files-from was in effect and
      the daemon was the receiver.

    - The --compare-dest option was not updating a file that differed in
      (the preserved) attributes from the version in the compare-dest DIR.

    - When rsync is copying files into a write-protected directory, fixed
      the change-report output for the directory so that we don't report
      an identical directory as changed.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Rsync now supports popt's option aliases, which means that you can
      use /etc/popt and/or ~/.popt to create your own option aliases.

    - Added the --delete-during (--del) option which will delete files
      from the receiving side incrementally as each directory in the
      transfer is being processed.  This makes it more efficient than the
      default, before-the-transfer behavior, which is now also available as
      --delete-before (and is still the default --delete-WHEN option that
      will be chosen if --delete or --delete-excluded is specified without
      a --delete-WHEN choice).  All the --del* options infer --delete, so
      an rsync daemon that refuses "delete" will still refuse to allow any
      file-deleting options (including the new --remove-sent-files option).

    - All the --delete-WHEN options are now more memory efficient:
      Previously an duplicate set of file-list objects was created on the
      receiving side for the entire destination hierarchy.  The new
      algorithm only creates one directory of objects at a time (for files
      inside the transfer).

    - Added the --copy-dest option, which works like --link-dest except
      that it locally copies identical files instead of hard-linking them.

    - Added support for specifying multiple --compare-dest, --copy-dest, or
      --link-dest options, but only of a single type. (Promoted from the
      patches dir and enhanced.) (Requires protocol 29.)

    - Added the --max-size option. (Promoted from the patches dir.)

    - The daemon-mode options are now separated from the normal rsync
      options so that they can't be mixed together.  This makes it
      impossible to start a daemon that has improper default option values
      (which could cause problems when a client connects, such as hanging
      or crashing).

    - The --bwlimit option may now be used in combination with --daemon
      to specify both a default value for the daemon side and a value
      that cannot be exceeded by a user-specified --bwlimit option.

    - Added the "port" parameter to the rsyncd.conf file. (Promoted from
      the patches dir.)  Also added "address".  The command-line options
      take precedence over a config-file option, as expected.

    - In _exit_cleanup(): when we are exiting with a partially-received
      file, we now flush any data in the write-cache before closing the
      partial file.

    - The --inplace support was enhanced to work with --compare-dest,
      --link-dest, and (the new) --copy-dest options. (Requires protocol
      29.)

    - Added the --dirs (-d) option for an easier way to copy directories
      without recursion.  Any directories that are encountered are created
      on the destination.  Specifying a directory with a trailing slash
      copies its immediate contents to the destination.

    - The --files-from option now implies --dirs (-d).

    - Added the --list-only option, which is mainly a way for the client to
      put the server into listing mode without needing to resort to any
      internal option kluges (e.g. the age-old use of "-r --exclude="/*/*"
      for a non-recursive listing).  This option is used automatically
      (behind the scenes) when a modern rsync speaks to a modern daemon,
      but may also be specified manually if you want to force the use of
      the --list-only option over a remote-shell connection.

    - Added the --omit-dir-times (-O) option, which will avoid updating
      the modified time for directories when --times was specified.  This
      option will avoid an extra pass through the file-list at the end of
      the transfer (to tweak all the directory times), which may provide
      an appreciable speedup for a really large transfer. (Promoted from
      the patches dir.)

    - Added the --filter (-f) option and its helper option, -F.  Filter
      rules are an extension to the existing include/exclude handling
      that also supports nested filter files as well as per-directory
      filter files (like .cvsignore, but with full filter-rule parsing).
      This new option was chosen in order to ensure that all existing
      include/exclude processing remained 100% compatible with older
      versions.  Protocol 29 is needed for full filter-rule support, but
      backward-compatible rules work with earlier protocol versions.
      (Promoted from the patches dir and enhanced.)

    - Added the --delay-updates option that puts all updated files into
      a temporary directory (by default ".~tmp~", but settable via the
      --partial-dir=DIR option) until the end of the transfer.  This
      makes the updates a little more atomic for a large transfer.

    - If rsync is put into the background, any output from --progress is
      reduced.

    - Documented the "max verbosity" setting for rsyncd.conf.  (This
      setting was added a couple releases ago, but left undocumented.)

    - The sender and the generator now double-check the file-list index
      they are given, and refuse to try to do a file transfer on a
      non-file index (since that would indicate that something had gone
      very wrong).

    - Added the --itemize-changes (-i) option, which is a way to output a
      more detailed list of what files changed and in what way.  The effect
      is the same as specifying a --log-format of "%i %n%L" (see both the
      rsync and rsyncd.conf manpages).  Works with --dry-run too.

    - Added the --fuzzy (-y) option, which attempts to find a basis file
      for a file that is being created from scratch.  The current algorithm
      only looks in the destination directory for the created file, but it
      does attempt to find a match based on size/mod-time (in case the file
      was renamed with no other changes) as well as based on a fuzzy
      name-matching algorithm.  This option requires protocol 29 because it
      needs the new file-sorting order.  (Promoted from patches dir and
      enhanced.) (Requires protocol 29.)

    - Added the --remove-sent-files option, which lets you move files
      between systems.

    - The hostname in HOST:PATH or HOST::PATH may now be an IPv6 literal
      enclosed in '[' and ']' (e.g. "[::1]").  (We already allowed IPv6
      literals in the rsync://HOST:PORT/PATH format.)

    - When rsync recurses to build the file list, it no longer keeps open
      one or more directory handles from the dir's parent dirs.

    - When building under windows, the default for --daemon is now to
      avoid detaching, requiring the new --detach option to force rsync
      to detach.

    - The --dry-run option can now be combined with either --write-batch or
      --read-batch, allowing you to run a do-nothing test command to see
      what would happen without --dry-run.

    - The daemon's "read only" config item now sets an internal read_only
      variable that makes extra sure that no write/delete calls on the
      read-only side can succeed.

    - The log-format % escapes can now have a numeric field width in
      between the % and the escape letter (e.g. "%-40n %08p").

    - Improved the option descriptions in the --help text.

  SUPPORT FILES:

    - Added atomic-rsync to the support dir: a perl script that will
      transfer some files using rsync, and then move the updated files into
      place all at once at the end of the transfer.  Only works when
      pulling, and uses --link-dest and a parallel hierarchy of files to
      effect its update.

    - Added mnt-excl to the support dir: a perl script that takes the
      /proc/mounts file and translates it into a set of excludes that will
      exclude all mount points (even mapped mounts to the same disk).  The
      excludes are made relative to the specified source dir and properly
      anchored.

    - Added savetransfer.c to the support dir: a C program that can make
      a copy of all the data that flows over the wire.  This lets you test
      for data corruption (by saving the data on both the sending side and
      the receiving side) and provides one way to debug a protocol error.

    - Added rrsync to the support dir: this is an updated version of Joe
      Smith's restricted rsync perl script.  This helps to ensure that only
      certain rsync commands can be run by an ssh invocation.

  INTERNAL:

    - Added better checking of the checksum-header values that come over
      the socket.

    - Merged a variety of file-deleting functions into a single function so
      that it is easier to maintain.

    - Improved the type of some variables (particularly blocksize vars) for
      consistency and proper size.

    - Got rid of the uint64 type (which we didn't need).

    - Use a slightly more compatible set of core #include directives.

    - Defined int32 in a way that ensures that the build dies if we can't
      find a variable with at least 32 bits.

  PROTOCOL DIFFERENCES FOR VERSION 29:

    - A 16-bit flag-word is transmitted after every file-list index.  This
      indicates what is changing between the sender and the receiver.  The
      generator now transmits an index and a flag-word to indicate when
      dirs and symlinks have changed (instead of producing a message),
      which makes the outputting of the information more consistent and
      less prone to screen corruption (because the local receiver/sender is
      now outputting all the file-change info messages).

    - If a file is being hard-linked, the ITEM_XNAME_FOLLOWS bit is enabled
      in the flag-word and the name of the file that was linked immediately
      follows in vstring format (see below).

    - If a file is being transferred with an alternate-basis file, the
      ITEM_BASIS_TYPE_FOLLOWS bit is enabled in the flag-word and a single
      byte follows, indicating what type of basis file was chosen.  If that
      indicates that a fuzzy-match was selected, the ITEM_XNAME_FOLLOWS bit
      is set in the flag-word and the name of the match in vstring format
      follows the basis byte.  A vstring is a variable length string that
      has its size written prior to the string, and no terminating null.
      If the string is from 1-127 bytes, the length is a single byte.  If
      it is from 128-32767 bytes, the length is written as ((len >> 8) |
      0x80) followed by (len % 0x100).

    - The sending of exclude names is done using filter-rule syntax.  This
      means that all names have a prefixed rule indicator, even excludes
      (which used to be sent as a bare pattern, when possible).  The -C
      option will include the per-dir .cvsignore merge file in the list of
      filter rules so it is positioned correctly (unlike in some older
      transfer scenarios).

    - Rsync sorts the filename list in a different way: it sorts the subdir
      names after the non-subdir names for each dir's contents, and it
      always puts a dir's contents immediately after the dir's name in the
      list.  (Previously an item named "foo.txt" would sort in between
      directory "foo/" and "foo/bar".)

    - When talking to a protocol 29 rsync daemon, a list-only request
      is able to note this before the options are sent over the wire and
      the new --list-only option is included in the options.

    - When the --stats bytes are sent over the wire (or stored in a batch),
      they now include two elapsed-time values: one for how long it took to
      build the file-list, and one for how long it took to send it over the
      wire (each expressed in thousandths of a second).

    - When --delete-excluded is specified with some filter rules (AKA
      excludes), a client sender will now initiate a send of the rules to
      the receiver (older protocols used to omit the sending of excludes in
      this situation since there were no receiver-specific rules that
      survived --delete-excluded back then).  Note that, as with all the
      filter-list sending, only items that are significant to the other
      side will actually be sent over the wire, so the filter-rule list
      that is sent in this scenario is often empty.

    - An index equal to the file-list count is sent as a keep-alive packet
      from the generator to the sender, which then forwards it on to the
      receiver.  This normally invalid index is only a valid keep-alive
      packet if the 16-bit flag-word that follows it contains a single bit
      (ITEM_IS_NEW, which is normally an illegal flag to appear alone).

    - A protocol-29 batch file includes a bit for the setting of the --dirs
      option and for the setting of the --compress option.  Also, the shell
      script created by --write-batch will use the --filter option instead
      of --exclude-from to capture any filter rules.

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Handle an operating system that use mkdev() in place of makedev().

    - Improved configure to better handle cross-compiling.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.3 (30 Sep 2004)
Protocol: 28 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.2:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    - A bug in the sanitize_path routine (which affects a non-chrooted
      rsync daemon) could allow a user to craft a pathname that would get
      transformed into an absolute path for certain options (but not for
      file-transfer names).  If you're running an rsync daemon with chroot
      disabled, *please upgrade*, ESPECIALLY if the user privs you run
      rsync under is anything above "nobody".

  OUTPUT CHANGES (ATTN: those using a script to parse the verbose output):

    - Please note that the 2-line footer (output when verbose) now uses the
      term "sent" instead of "wrote" and "received" instead of "read".  If
      you are not parsing the numeric values out of this footer, a script
      would be better off using the empty line prior to the footer as the
      indicator that the verbose output is over.
      
    - The output from the --stats option was similarly affected to change
      "written" to "sent" and "read" to "received".

    - Rsync ensures that a filename that contains a newline gets mentioned
      with each newline transformed into a question mark (which prevents a
      filename from causing an empty line to be output).

    - The "backed up ..." message that is output when at least 2 --verbose
      options are specified is now the same both with and without the
      --backup-dir option.

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a crash bug that might appear when --delete was used and
      multiple source directories were specified.

    - Fixed a 32-bit truncation of the file length when generating the
      checksums.

    - The --backup code no longer attempts to create some directories
      over and over again (generating warnings along the way).

    - Fixed a bug in the reading of the secrets file (by the daemon) and
      the password file (by the client):  the files no longer need to be
      terminated by a newline for their content to be read in.

    - If a file has a read error on the sending side or the reconstructed
      data doesn't match the expected checksum (perhaps due to the basis
      file changing during the transfer), the receiver will no longer
      retain the resulting file unless the --partial option was specified.
      (Note: for the read-error detection to work, neither side can be
      older than 2.6.3 -- older receivers will always retain the file, and
      older senders don't tell the receiver that the file had a read
      error.)

    - If a file gets resent in a single transfer and the --backup option
      is enabled, rsync no longer performs a duplicate backup (it used to
      overwrite the original file in the backup area).

    - Files specified in the daemon's "exclude" or "exclude from" config
      items are now excluded from being uploaded (assuming that the module
      allows uploading at all) in addition to the old download exclusion.

    - Got rid of a potential hang in the receiver when near the end of a
      phase.

    - When using --backup without a --backup-dir, rsync no longer preserves
      the modify time on directories.  This avoids confusing NFS.

    - When --copy-links (-L) is specified, we now output a separate error
      for a symlink that has no referent instead of claiming that a file
      "vanished".

    - The --copy-links (-L) option no longer has the side-effect of telling
      the receiving side to follow symlinks.  See the --keep-dirlinks
      option (mentioned below) for a way to specify that behavior.

    - Error messages from the daemon server's option-parsing (such as
      refused options) are now successfully transferred back to the client
      (the server used to fail to send the message because the socket
      wasn't in the right state for the message to get through).

    - Most transfer errors that occur during a daemon transfer are now
      returned to the user in addition to being logged (some messages are
      intended to be daemon-only and are not affected by this).

    - Fixed a bug in the daemon authentication code when using one of the
      batch-processing options.

    - We try to work around some buggy IPv6 implementations that fail to
      implement IPV6_V6ONLY.  This should fix the "address in use" error
      that some daemons get when running on an OS with a buggy IPv6
      implementation.  Also, if the new code gets this error, we might
      suggest that the user specify --ipv4 or --ipv6 (if we think it will
      help).

    - When the remote rsync dies, make a better effort to recover any error
      messages it may have sent before dying (the local rsync used to just
      die with a socket-write error).

    - When using --delete and a --backup-dir that contains files that are
      hard-linked to their destination equivalents, rsync now makes sure
      that removed files really get removed (avoids a really weird rename()
      behavior).

    - Avoid a bogus run-time complaint about a lack of 64-bit integers when
      the int64 type is defined as an off_t and it actually has 64-bits.

    - Added a configure check for open64() without mkstemp64() so that we
      can avoid using mkstemp() when such a combination is encountered.
      This bypasses a problem writing out large temp files on OSes such as
      AIX and HP-UX.

    - Fixed an age-old crash problem with --read-batch on a local copy
      (rsync was improperly assuming --whole-file for the local copy).

    - When --dry-run (-n) is used and the destination directory does not
      exist, rsync now produces a correct report of files that would be
      sent instead of dying with a chdir() error.

    - Fixed a bug that could cause a slow-to-connect rsync daemon to die
      with an error instead of waiting for the connection to finish.

    - Fixed an ssh interaction that could cause output to be lost when the
      user chose to combine the output of rsync's stdout and stderr (e.g.
      using the "2>&1").

    - Fixed an option-parsing bug when --files-from got passed to a daemon.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the --partial-dir=DIR option that lets you specify where to
      (temporarily) put a partially transferred file (instead of over-
      writing the destination file).  E.g.  --partial-dir=.rsync-partial
      Also added support for the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment variable
      that, when found, transforms a regular --partial option (such as
      the convenient -P option) into one that also specifies a directory.

    - Added --keep-dirlinks (-K), which allows you to symlink a directory
      onto another partition on the receiving side and have rsync treat it
      as matching a normal directory from the sender.

    - Added the --inplace option that tells rsync to write each destination
      file without using a temporary file.  The matching of existing data
      in the destination file can be severely limited by this, but there
      are also cases where this is more efficient (such as appending data).
      Use only when needed (see the man page for more details).

    - Added the "write only" option for the daemon's config file.

    - Added long-option names for -4 and -6 (namely --ipv4 and --ipv6)
      and documented all these options in the man page.

    - Improved the handling of the --bwlimit option so that it's less
      bursty, more accurate, and works properly over a larger range of
      values.

    - The rsync daemon-over-ssh code now looks for SSH_CONNECTION and
      SSH2_CLIENT in addition to SSH_CLIENT to figure out the IP address.

    - Added the --checksum-seed=N option for advanced users.

    - Batch writing/reading has a brand-new implementation that is simpler,
      fixes a few weird problems with the old code (such as no longer
      sprinkling the batch files into different dirs or even onto different
      systems), and is much less intrusive into the code (making it easier
      to maintain for the future).  The new code generates just one data
      file instead of three, which makes it possible to read the batch on
      stdin via a remote shell.  Also, the old requirement of forcing the
      same fixed checksum-seed for all batch processing has been removed.

    - If an rsync daemon has a module set with "list = no" (which hides its
      presence in the list of available modules), a user that fails to
      authenticate gets the same "unknown module" error that they would get
      if the module were actually unknown (while still logging the real
      error to the daemon's log file).  This prevents fishing for module
      names.

    - The daemon's "refuse options" config item now allows you to match
      option names using wildcards and/or the single-letter option names.

    - Each transferred file now gets its permissions and modified-time
      updated before the temp-file gets moved into place.  Previously, the
      finished file would have a very brief window where its permissions
      disallowed all group and world access.

    - Added the ability to parse a literal IPv6 address in an "rsync:" URL
      (e.g. rsync://[2001:638:500:101::21]:873/module/dir).

    - The daemon's wildcard expanding code can now handle more than 1000
      filenames (it's now limited by memory instead of having a hard-wired
      limit).

  INTERNAL:

    - Some cleanup in the exclude code has saved some per-exclude memory
      and made the code easier to maintain.

    - Improved the argv-overflow checking for a remote command that has a
      lot of args.

    - Use rsyserr() in the various places that were still calling rprintf()
      with strerror() as an arg.

    - If an rsync daemon is listening on multiple sockets (to handle both
      IPv4 and IPv6 to a single port), we now close all the unneeded file
      handles after we accept a connection (we used to close just one of
      them).

    - Optimized the handling of larger block sizes (rsync used to slow to a
      crawl if the block size got too large).

    - Optimized away a loop in hash_search().

    - Some improvements to the sanitize_path() and clean_fname() functions
      makes them more efficient and produce better results (while still
      being compatible with the file-name cleaning that gets done on both
      sides when sending the file-list).

    - Got rid of alloc_sanitize_path() after adding a destination-buffer
      arg to sanitize_path() made it possible to put all the former's
      functionality into the latter.

    - The file-list that is output when at least 4 verbose options are
      specified reports the uid value on the sender even when rsync is
      not running as root (since we might be sending to a root receiver).

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Added a "gen" target to rebuild most of the generated files,
      including configure, config.h.in, the man pages, and proto.h.

    - If "make proto" doesn't find some changes in the prototypes, the
      proto.h file is left untouched (its time-stamp used to always be
      updated).

    - The variable $STRIP (that is optionally set by the install-strip
      target's rule) was changed to $INSTALL_STRIP because some systems
      have $STRIP already set in the environment.

    - Fixed a build problem when SUPPORT_HARD_LINKS isn't defined.

    - When cross-compiling, the gettimeofday() function is now assumed to
      be a modern version that takes two-args (since we can't test it).

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - The scripts in the testsuite dir were cleaned up a bit and a few
      new tests added.

    - Some new diffs were added to the patches dir, and some accepted
      ones were removed.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.2 (30 Apr 2004)
Protocol: 28 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.6.1:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a major bug in the sorting of the filenames when --relative
      is used for some sources (just sources such as "/" and "/*" were
      affected).  This fix ensures that we ask for the right file-list
      item when requesting changes from the sender.

    - Rsync now checks the return value of the close() function to
      better report disk-full problems on an NFS file system.

    - Restored the old daemon-server behavior of logging error messages
      rather than returning them to the user.  (A better long-term fix
      will be sought in the future.)

    - An obscure uninitialized-variable bug was fixed in the uid/gid
      code.  (This bug probably had no ill effects.)

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - Got rid of the configure check for sys/sysctl.h (it wasn't used
      and was causing a problem on some systems).  Also improved the
      broken-largefile-locking test to try to avoid failure due to an
      NFS build-dir.

    - Fixed a compile problem on systems that don't define
      AI_NUMERICHOST.

    - Fixed a compile problem in the popt source for compilers that
      don't support __attribute__.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Improved the testsuite's "merge" test to work on OSF1.

    - Two new diffs were added to the patches dir.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.1 (26 Apr 2004)
Protocol: 28 (changed)
Changes since 2.6.0:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    - Paths sent to an rsync daemon are more thoroughly sanitized when
      chroot is not used.  If you're running a non-read-only rsync
      daemon with chroot disabled, *please upgrade*, ESPECIALLY if the
      user privs you run rsync under is anything above "nobody".

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Lower memory use, more optimal transfer of data over the socket,
      and lower CPU usage (see the INTERNAL section for details).

    - The RSYNC_PROXY environment variable can now contain a
      "USER:PASS@" prefix before the "HOST:PORT" information.
      (Bardur Arantsson)

    - The --progress output now mentions how far along in the transfer
      we are, including both a count of files transferred and a
      percentage of the total file-count that we've processed.  It also
      shows better current-rate-of-transfer and remaining-transfer-time
      values.

    - Documentation changes now attempt to describe some often mis-
      understood features more clearly.

  BUG FIXES:

    - When -x (--one-file-system) is combined with -L (--copy-links) or
      --copy-unsafe-links, no symlinked files are skipped, even if the
      referent file is on a different filesystem.

    - The --link-dest code now works properly for a non-root user when
      (1) the UIDs of the source and destination differ and -o was
      specified, or (2) when the group of the source can't be used on
      the destination and -g was specified.

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of -H (hard-links) that might cause
      the expanded PATH/NAME value of the current item to get
      overwritten (due to an expanded-name caching bug).
      
    - We now reset the "new data has been sent" flag at the start of
      each file we send.  This makes sure that an interrupted transfer
      with the --partial option set doesn't keep a shorter temp file
      than the current basis file when no new data has been transferred
      over the wire for that file.

    - Fixed a byte-order problem in --batch-mode on big-endian machines.
      (Jay Fenlason)

    - When using --cvs-exclude, the exclude items we get from a
      per-directory's .cvsignore file once again only affect that one
      directory (not all following directories too).  The items are also
      now properly word-split and parsed without any +/- prefix parsing.

    - When specifying the USER@HOST: prefix for a file, the USER part
      can now contain an '@', if needed (i.e. the last '@' is used to
      find the HOST, not the first).

    - Fixed some bugs in the handling of group IDs for non-root users:
      (1) It properly handles a group that the sender didn't have a name
      for (it would previously skip changing the group on any files in
      that group).  (2) If --numeric-ids is used, rsync no longer
      attempts to set groups that the user doesn't have the permission
      to set.

    - Fixed the "refuse options" setting in the rsyncd.conf file.

    - Improved the -x (--one-file-system) flag's handling of any mount-
      point directories we encounter.  It is both more optimal (in that
      it no longer does a useless scan of the contents of the mount-
      point dirs) and also fixes a bug where a remapped mount of the
      original filesystem could get discovered in a subdir we should be
      ignoring.

    - Rsync no longer discards a double-slash at the start of a filename
      when trying to open the file.  It also no longer constructs names
      that start with a double slash (unless the user supplied them).

    - Path-specifying options to a daemon should now work the same with
      or without chroot turned on.  Previously, such a option (such as
      --link-dest) would get its absolute path munged into a relative
      one if chroot was not on, making that setting fairly useless.
      Rsync now transforms the path into one that is based on the
      module's base dir when chroot is not enabled.

    - Fixed a compatibility problem interacting with older rsync
      versions that might send us an empty --suffix value without
      telling us that --backup-dir was specified.

    - The "hosts allow" option for a daemon-over-remote-shell process
      now has improved support for IPv6 addresses and a fix for systems
      that have a length field in their socket structs.

    - Fixed the ability to request an empty backup --suffix when sending
      files to an rsync daemon.

    - Fixed an option-parsing bug when --files-from was sent to a server
      sender.

  INTERNAL:

    - Most of the I/O is now buffered, which results in a pretty large
      speedup when running under MS Windows.  (Craig Barratt)

    - Optimizations to the name-handling/comparing code have made some
      significant reductions in user-CPU time for large file sets.

    - Some cleanup of the variable types make the code more consistent.

    - Reduced memory requirements of hard link preservation.
      (J.W. Schultz)

    - Implemented a new algorithm for hard-link handling that speeds up
      the code significantly.  (J.W. Schultz and Wayne Davison)

    - The --hard-link option now uses the first existing file in the
      group of linked files as the basis for the transfer.  This
      prevents the sub-optimal transfer of a file's data when a new
      hardlink is added on the sending side and it sorts alphabetically
      earlier in the list than the files that are already present on the
      receiving side.

    - Dropped support for protocol versions less than 20 (2.3.0 released
      15 Mar 1999) and activated warnings for protocols less than 25
      (2.5.0 released 23 Aug 2001). (Wayne Davison and J.W. Schultz,
      severally)

    - More optimal data transmission for --hard-links (protocol 28).

    - More optimal data transmission for --checksum (protocol 28).

    - Less memory is used when --checksum is specified.

    - Less memory is used in the file list (a per-file savings).

    - The generator is now better about not modifying the file list
      during the transfer in order to avoid a copy-on-write memory
      bifurcation (on systems where fork() uses shared memory).
      Previously, rsync's shared memory would slowly become unshared,
      resulting in real memory usage nearly doubling on the receiving
      side by the end of the transfer.  Now, as long as permissions
      are being preserved, the shared memory should remain that way
      for the entire transfer.

    - Changed hardlink info and file_struct + strings to use allocation
      pools.  This reduces memory use for large file-sets and permits
      freeing memory to the OS.  (J.W. Schultz) 

    - The 2 pipes used between the receiver and generator processes
      (which are forked on the same machine) were reduced to 1 pipe and
      the protocol improved so that (1) it is now impossible to have the
      "redo" pipe fill up and hang rsync, and (2) trailing messages from
      the receiver don't get lost on their way through the generator
      over to the sender (which mainly affected hard-link messages and
      verbose --stats output).

    - Improved the internal uid/gid code to be more portable and a
      little more optimized.

    - The device numbers sent when using --devices are now sent as
      separate major/minor values with 32-bit accuracy (protocol 28).
      Previously, the copied devices were sent as a single 32-bit
      number.  This will make inter-operation of 64-bit binaries more
      compatible with their 32-bit brethren (with both ends of the
      connection are using protocol 28).  Note that optimizations in the
      binary protocol for sending the device numbers often results in
      fewer bytes being used than before, even though more precision is
      now available.

    - Some cleanup of the exclude/include structures and its code made
      things clearer (internally), simpler, and more efficient.

    - The reading & writing of the file-list in batch-mode is now
      handled by the same code that sends & receives the list over the
      wire.  This makes it much easier to maintain.  (Note that the
      batch code is still considered to be experimental.)

  BUILD CHANGES:

    - The configure script now accepts --with-rsyncd-conf=PATH to
      override the default value of the /etc/rsyncd.conf file.

    - Fixed configure bug when running "./configure --disable-ipv6".

    - Fixed compilation problem on Tru64 Unix (having to do with
      sockaddr.sa_len and sockaddr.sin_len).

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Fixed "make test" bug when build dir is not the source dir.

    - Added a couple extra diffs in the "patches" dir, removed the ones
      that got applied, and rebuilt the rest.


NEWS for rsync 2.6.0 (1 Jan 2004)
Protocol: 27 (changed)
Changes since 2.5.7:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * "ssh" is now the default remote shell for rsync.  If you want to
      change this, configure like this:  "./configure --with-rsh=rsh".

    * Added --files-from, --no-relative, --no-implied-dirs, and --from0.
      Note that --from0 affects the line-ending character for all the
      files read by the --*-from options. (Wayne Davison)

    * Length of csum2 is now per-file starting with protocol version
      27. (J.W. Schultz)

    * Per-file dynamic block size is now sqrt(file length).  The
      per-file checksum size is determined according to an algorithm
      provided by Donovan Baarda which reduces the probability of rsync
      algorithm corrupting data and falling back using the whole md4
      checksums. (J.W. Schultz, Donovan Baarda)

    * The --stats option no longer includes the (debug) malloc summary
      unless the verbose option was specified at least twice.

    * Added a new error/warning code for when files vanish from the
      sending side.  Made vanished source files not interfere with the
      file-deletion pass when --delete-after was specified.

    * Various trailing-info sections are now preceded by a newline.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed several exclude/include matching bugs when using wild-cards.
      This has a several user-visible effects, all of which make the
      matching more consistent and intuitive.  This should hopefully not
      cause anyone problems since it makes the matching work more like
      what people are expecting. (Wayne Davison)

      - A pattern with a "**" no longer causes a "*" to match slashes.
        For example, with "/*/foo/**", "foo" must be 2 levels deep.
	[If your string has BOTH "*" and "**" wildcards, changing the
	"*" wildcards to "**" will provide the old behavior in all
	versions.]

      - "**/foo" now matches at the base of the transfer (like /foo
        does).  [Use "/**/foo" to get the old behavior in all versions.]

      - A non-anchored wildcard term floats to match beyond the base of
        the transfer.  E.g. "CVS/R*" matches at the end of the path,
        just like the non-wildcard term "CVS/Root" does. [Use "/CVS/R*"
        to get the old behavior in all versions.]

      - Including a "**" in the match term causes it to be matched
        against the entire path, not just the name portion, even if
        there aren't any interior slashes in the term.  E.g. "foo**bar"
        would exclude "/path/foo-bar" (just like before) as well as
        "/foo-path/baz-bar" (unlike before).  [Use "foo*bar" to get the
        old behavior in all versions.]

    * The exclude list specified in the daemon's config file is now
      properly applied to the pulled items no matter how deep the
      user's file-args are in the source tree.  (Wayne Davison)

    * For protocol version >= 27, mdfour_tail() is called when the
      block size (including checksum_seed) is a multiple of 64.
      Previously it was not called, giving the wrong MD4 checksum.
      (Craig Barratt)

    * For protocol version >= 27, a 64 bit bit counter is used in
      mdfour.c as required by the RFC.  Previously only a 32 bit bit
      counter was used, causing incorrect MD4 file checksums for
      file sizes >= 512MB - 4.  (Craig Barratt)

    * Fixed a crash bug when interacting with older rsync versions and
      multiple files of the same name are destined for the same dir.
      (Wayne Davison)

    * Keep tmp names from overflowing MAXPATHLEN.

    * Make --link-dest honor the absence of -p, -o, and -g.

    * Made rsync treat a trailing slash in the destination in a more
      consistent manner.

    * Fixed file I/O error detection.  (John Van Essen)

    * Fixed bogus "malformed address {hostname}" message in rsyncd log
      when checking IP address against hostnames from "hosts allow"
      and "hosts deny" parameters in config file.

    * Print heap statistics when verbose >= 2 instead of when >= 1.

    * Fixed a compression (-z) bug when syncing a mostly-matching file
      that contains already-compressed data.  (Yasuoka Masahiko and
      Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed a bug in the --backup code that could cause deleted files
      to not get backed up.

    * When the backup code makes new directories, create them with mode
      0700 instead of 0755 (since the directory permissions in the
      backup tree are not yet copied from the main tree).

    * Call setgroups() in a more portable manner.

    * Improved file-related error messages to better indicate exactly
      what pathname failed. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed some bugs in the handling of --delete and --exclude when
      using the --relative (-R) option. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed bug that prevented regular files from replacing
      special files and caused a directory in --link-dest or
      --compare-dest to block the creation of a file with the
      same path.  A directory still cannot be replaced by a
      regular file unless --delete specified.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * Detect and report when open or opendir succeed but read and
      readdir fail caused by network filesystem issues and truncated
      files.  (David Norwood, Michael Brown, J.W. Schultz)

    * Added a fix that should give ssh time to restore the tty settings
      if the user presses Ctrl-C at an ssh password prompt.

  INTERNAL:

    * Eliminated vestigial support for old versions that we stopped
      supporting. (J.W. Schultz)

    * Simplified some of the option-parsing code. (Wayne Davison)

    * Some cleanup made to the exclude code, as well as some new
      defines added to enhance readability. (Wayne Davison)

    * Changed the protocol-version code so that it can interact at a
      lower protocol level than the maximum supported by both sides.
      Added an undocumented option, --protocol=N, to force the value
      we advertise to the other side (primarily for testing purposes).

NEWS for rsync 2.5.6, aka "the dwd-between-jobs release" (26 Jan 2003)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.5:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * The --delete-after option now implies --delete.  (Wayne Davison)

    * The --suffix option can now be used with --backup-dir.  (Michael
      Zimmerman)

    * Combining "::" syntax with the --rsh/-e option now uses the
      specified remote-shell as a transport to talk to a (newly-spawned)
      server-daemon.  This allows someone to use daemon features, such
      as modules, over a secure protocol, such as ssh.  (JD Paul)

    * The rsync:// syntax for daemon connections is now accepted in the
      destination field.

    * If the file name given to --include-from or --exclude-from is "-",
      rsync will read from standard input.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * New option --link-dest which is like --compare-dest except that
      unchanged files are hard-linked in to the destination directory.
      (J.W. Schultz)

    * Don't report an error if an excluded file disappears during an
      rsync run.  (Eugene Chupriyanov and Bo Kersey)

    * Added .svn to --cvs-exclude list to support subversion.  (Jon
      Middleton)

    * Properly support IPv6 addresses in the rsyncd.conf "hosts allow"
      and "hosts deny" fields.  (Hideaki Yoshifuji)

    * Changed exclude file handling to permit DOS or MAC style line
      terminations.  (J.W. Schultz)

    * Ignore errors from chmod when -p/-a/--preserve-perms is not set.
      (Dave Dykstra)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix "forward name lookup failed" errors on AIX 4.3.3.  (John
      L. Allen, Martin Pool)

    * Generate each file's rolling-checksum data as we send it, not
      in a separate (memory-eating) pass before hand.  This prevents
      timeout errors on really large files. (Stefan Nehlsen)

    * Fix compilation on Tru64.  (Albert Chin, Zoong Pham)

    * Better handling of some client-server errors.  (Martin Pool)

    * Fixed a crash that would occur when sending a list of files that
      contains a duplicate name (if it sorts to the end of the file
      list) and using --delete.  (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed the file-name duplicate-removal code when dealing with multiple
      dups in a row. (Wayne Davison)

    * Fixed a bug that caused rsync to lose the exit status of its child
      processes and sometimes return an exit code of 0 instead of showing
      an error.  (David R. Staples, Dave Dykstra)

    * Fixed bug in --copy-unsafe-links that caused it to be completely
      broken.  (Dave Dykstra)

    * Prevent infinite recursion in cleanup code under certain circumstances.
      (Sviatoslav Sviridov and Marc Espie)

    * Fixed a bug that prevented rsync from creating intervening directories
      when --relative-paths/-R is set.  (Craig Barratt)

    * Prevent "Connection reset by peer" messages from Cygwin. (Randy O'Meara)

  INTERNAL:

    * Many code cleanups and improved internal documentation.  (Martin
      Pool, Nelson Beebe)

    * Portability fixes. (Dave Dykstra and Wayne Davison)

    * More test cases.  (Martin Pool)

    * Some test-case fixes.  (Brian Poole, Wayne Davison)

    * Updated included popt to the latest vendor drop, version 1.6.4.
      (Jos Backus)

    * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest versions; this
      means rsync should build on more platforms.  (Paul Green)


NEWS for rsync 2.5.5, aka Snowy River (2 Apr 2002)
Protocol: 26 (unchanged)
Changes since 2.5.4:

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With --progress, when a transfer is complete show the time taken;
      otherwise show expected time to complete. (Cameron Simpson)

    * Make "make install-strip" works properly, and "make install"
      accepts a DESTDIR variable for help in building binary packages.
      (Peter Breitenlohner, Greg Louis)

    * If configured with --enable-maintainer-mode, then on receipt of
      a fatal signal rsync will try to open an xterm running gdb,
      similarly to Samba's "panic action" or GNOME's bug-buddy.
      (Martin Pool)


  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix situation where failure to fork (e.g. because out of process
      slots) would cause rsync to kill all processes owned by the
      current user.  Yes, really!  (Paul Haas, Martin Pool)

    * Fix test suite on Solaris.  (Jos Backus, Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor memory leak in socket code.  (Dave Dykstra, Martin
      Pool.)

    * Fix --whole-file problem that caused it to be the default even
      for remote connections.  (Martin Pool, Frank Schulz)

    * Work around bug in Mac OS X mkdir(2), which cannot handle
      trailing slashes.
      <http://www.opensource.apple.com/bugs/X/BSD%20Kernel/2734739.html>

    * Make sure that supplementary groups are removed from a server
      process after changing uid and gid. (Ethan Benson) (Debian bug
      #132272, CVE CAN-2002-0080)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix zlib double-free bug.  (Owen Taylor, Mark J Cox) (CVE
      CAN-2002-0059)

    * Fixed problem that in many cases caused the error message
	unexpected read size of 0 in map_ptr
      and resulted in the wrong data being copied.

    * Fixed compilation errors on some systems caused by the use of
      "unsigned int64" in rsync.h.

    * Fixed problem on systems such as Sunos4 that do not support realloc
      on a NULL pointer; error was "out of memory in flist_expand".

    * Fix for rsync server processes hanging around after the client
      unexpectedly disconnects.  (Colin Walters) (Debian bug #128632)

    * Cope with BSD systems on which mkdir() will not accept a trailing
      slash.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Merge in changes from zlib 1.1.2 to zlib 1.1.3.  (Note that
      rsync still uses a custom version of zlib; you can not just link
      against a system library.  See zlib/README.rsync)

    * Command to initiate connections is only shown with -vv, rather
      than -v as in 2.5.2.  Output from plain -v is more similar to
      what was historically used so as not to break scripts that try
      to parse the output.

    * Added --no-whole-file and --no-blocking-io options (Dave Dykstra)

    * Made the --write-batch and --read-batch options actually work
      and added documentation in the man page (Jos Backus)

    * If the daemon is unable to fork a child to accept a connection,
      print an error message.  (Colin Walters)

      <krahmer@suse.de> -- in some cases we were not sufficiently
      careful about reading integers from the network.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix possible string mangling in log files.

    * Fix for setting local address of outgoing sockets.

    * Better handling of hardlinks and devices on platforms with
      64-bit dev_t or ino_t.

    * Name resolution on machines supporting IPv6 is improved.

    * Fix for device nodes.  (dann frazier)   (Debian #129135)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * With -v, rsync now shows the command used to initiate an ssh/rsh
      connection.

    * --statistics now shows memory heap usage on platforms that
      support mallinfo().

    * "The Ted T'so school of program optimization": make progress
      visible and people will think it's faster.  (With --progress,
      rsync will show you how many files it has seen as it builds the
      file_list, giving some indication that it has not hung.)

    * Improvements to batch mode support.  This is still experimental
      but testing would be welcome.   (Jos Backus)

    * Test suite typo fixes.  (Tom Schmidt)

    * rsync.1 grammar and clarity improvements.  (Edward
      Welbourne)

    * Correction to ./configure tests for inet_ntop.  (Jeff Garzik)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * --progress and -P now show estimated data transfer rate (in a
      multiple of bytes/s) and estimated time to completion.  (Rik
      Faith)

    * --no-detach option, required to run as a W32 service and also
      useful when running on Unix under daemontools, AIX's SRC, or a
      debugger.  (Max Bowsher, Jos Backus)

    * Clearer error messages for some conditions.


NEWS for rsync 2.5.0 (30 Nov 2001)
Protocol: 25 (changed)
Changes since 2.4.6:

  ANNOUNCEMENTS

    * Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org> is now a co-maintainer.

  NEW FEATURES

    * Support for LSB-compliant packaging <http://www.linuxbase.org/>

    * Shell wildcards are allowed in "auth users" lines.

    * Merged UNC rsync+ patch to support creation of standalone patch
      sets.  By Bert J. Dempsey and Debra Weiss, updated by Jos
      Backus.  <http://www.ils.unc.edu/i2dsi/unc_rsync+.html>

    * IPv6 support based on a patch from KAME.net, on systems
      including modern versions of Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX.  Also
      includes IPv6 compatibility functions for old OSs by the
      Internet Software Consortium, Paul Vixie, the OpenSSH
      portability project, and OpenBSD.

  ENHANCEMENTS

    * Include/exclude cluestick: with -vv, print out whether files are
      included or excluded and why.

    * Many error messages have more friendly explanations and more
      details.

    * Manual page improvements plus scanty protocol documentation.

    * When running as --daemon in the background and using a "log
      file" rsyncd.conf directive, close the log file every time it is
      open when going to sleep on the socket.  This allows the log
      file to get cleaned out by another process.

    * Change to using libpopt rather than getopt for processing
      options.	This makes the code cleaner and the behaviour more
      consistent across platforms.  popt is included and built if not
      installed on the platform.

    * More details in --version, including note about whether 64-bit
      files, symlinks and hardlinks are supported.

    * MD4 code may use less CPU cycles.

    * Use mkstemp on systems where it is secure.  If we use mktemp,
      explain that we do it in a secure way.

    * --whole-file is the default when source and target are on the
	local machine.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix for various bugs causing rsync to hang.

    * Attempt to fix Large File Summit support on AIX.

    * Attempt to fix error handling lockup bug.

    * Give a non-0 exit code if *any* of the files we have been asked
      to transfer fail to transfer.

    * For log messages containing ridiculously long strings that might
      overflow a buffer rsync no longer aborts, but rather prints an
      ellipsis at the end of the string.  (Patch from Ed Santiago.)

  PLATFORMS:

    * Improved support for UNICOS (tested on Cray T3E and Cray SV1)

    * autoconf2.52 (or later) is now required to rebuild the autoconf
      scripts.  It is not required to simply build rsync.
