automatic testsuite for rsync			-*- text -*-

We're trying to develop some more substantial tests to prevent rsync
regressions.  Ideally, all code changes or bug reports would come with
an appropriate test suite.

You can run these tests by typing "make check" in the build directory.
The tests will run using the rsync binary in the build directory, so
you do not need to do "make install" first.  Indeed, you probably
should not install rsync before running the tests.

If you instead type "make installcheck" then the suite will test the
rsync binary from its installed location (e.g. /usr/local/bin/rsync).
You can use this to test a distribution build, or perhaps to run a new
test suite against an old version of rsync.  Note that in accordance
with the GNU Standards, installcheck does not look for rsync on the
path.

If the tests pass, you should see a report to that effect.  Some tests
require being root or some other precondition, and so will normally not
be checked -- look at the test scripts for more information.

If the tests fail, you will see rather more output.  The scratch
directory will remain in the build directory.  It would be useful if
you could include the log messages when reporting a failure.

These tests also run automatically on the build farm, and you can see
the results on http://build.samba.org/.
