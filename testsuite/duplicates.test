# Test rsync handling of duplicate filenames.  

# It's quite possible that the user might specify the same source file
# more than once on the command line, perhaps through shell variables
# or wildcard expansions.  It might cause problems for rsync if the
# same name occurred more than once in the file list, because we might
# be trying to update the first copy and generate checksums for the
# second copy at the same time.  See clean_flist() for the implementation.

# We don't need to worry about hardlinks or symlinks.  Because we
# always rename-and-replace the new copy, they can't affect us.

# This test is not great, because it is a timing-dependent bug.
